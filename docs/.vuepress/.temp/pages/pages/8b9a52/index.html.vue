<h1 id="section-11-1-introduction-to-bodies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-1-introduction-to-bodies" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.1 Introduction to Bodies</h1>
<p>The body is one of the most complex assemblies of a passenger vehicle, consuming a large portion of a project's resources, both manpower and investment. Besides being a complex piece of engineering, it is alsc the element most tied to the vehicle's overall architecture and its appearance. The body structure and outer skin have four main functions:</p>
<p><strong>1. Protect the occupants and cargo</strong>
<strong>2. Provide attachment points for all other major components and manage the stress between them</strong>
<strong>3. Provide an appealing appearance and image for the product.</strong>
<strong>4. Provide an aerodynamic torm to improve performance and reduce wind noise.</strong></p>
<p>A car or truck body can be broken down into three main groups ot assemblies, namely: the underbody, upper body and closures. The underbody consists mainly of the floor panels and dash structure which are stiffened by a number of box sections to form a substructure. These box sections comprise the main longitudinal frame rails, the sills and the cross members. The powertrain and chassis components are attached to this. substructure which also serves as the primary crash structure, running out to the extremities of the body.</p>
<p>The upper body can be thought of as a framework surrounding a series of apertures and supporting the outer skin of the vehicle. Each aperture or opening is designed to provide access into the vehicle or visibility out of it.</p>
<p>The closures include the doors, hood, and trunk lid/tailgate These represent a large portion of the exterior surface and feature extensively in the early packaging studies..</p>
<p>The combination of box sections and &quot;shear&quot; panels serve to meet the four functional requirements listed on the previous page. The bulk of the work is done by the box sections (or beams) that are designed to withstand the enormous stresses that a vehicle will endure throughout its life. The design of the beams (pillars, sills, rails, cross members, etc.) are developed in a series of typical sections which are strategically cut through the main structure.The path and size (cross-sectional area and material thickness) of each section is determined by a structural analyst. He or she will use computer applications to ensure the body meets all of the requirements for torsional stiffness, durability, vibrational frequency and weight. The illustration on the opposite page shows a very primitive load path diagram which may be used to set up the structure. The bodies of nearly all mass-produced cars, minivans, trucks and SUVs are made from stamped steel although this migh change as weight reduction becomes more and more important to increase energy efficiency.Some premium vehicles substitute steel for pressed aluminum and, in som cases. extruded aluminum sections</p>
<p>In addition to the box sections, contoured panels (floor, dash roof, wheel houses, etc.) close off the structure, creating a weatherproof and fireproof compartment for the passengers and cargo. These and some of the glazing panels also add tq the structural integrity of the body and manage shear loads</p>
<p>The closures such as the hood, trunk lid and tailgate do not. add much to the dynamic structure, but they can play a majo role in crash protection. These are often made from materials that differ from the main structure (such as plastic) to reduce weight or provide attributes such as dent resistance while improving formability.</p>
<p>Bumper or fascia panels are usually made from damage. resistant plastics to meet low-speed impact requirements which are mandatory in many markets.Plastics can also be formed to shapes that are difficult to create in metal. It also allows several components such as grills, lamp housings,. scoops and badges to be made in one part, helping to redu. complexity and assembly time</p>
<p>The remaining exterior panels serve only to create an appealing, aerodynamic exterior form. The other exterior features and components such as glass, lighting, breathing apertures and license-plate pockets all need to be considered in the development of the body and its typical sections</p>
<h3 id="load-path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#load-path" aria-hidden="true">#</a> LOAD PATH</h3>
<p>This simple node diagram is created around the package by the structural analysts. The main load inputs from the suspension mounts and crash systems create the major load paths which thread through the body. From this the required cross-sectional areas of the main box sections are calculated These sections feature prominently in the vehicle package. Each box section or structural panel may be subiect to one or more of the forces shown below</p>

<p>The most efficient and cost-effective type of construction process for mass-produced cars, minivans and SUVs The structure is made from steel or aluminum panels 0.7-2.0mm thick).The panels are stamped into shape and then spot welded together to form a series of box sections and contoured panels. Exterior panels can be made of. metal or plastic depending on low-speed impact requirements,</p>

<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/bodyonframe1.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p>This type of construction is often used on pickup trucks and large. SUVs, helping to manage heavy loads and drive over rough terrain. It. also provides strength for increased towing capacity. The powertrain,. suspension and main body are all mounted separately to a high-. strength frame on rubber isolators to improve the ride quality, noise and vibration. Significant drawbacks of this type of structure are increased weight, higher floor height and poor torsional rigidity, which is importani for good handling and road holding..</p>

<p><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/spaceframe2.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
Space frames are typically used for low-volume-production performance cars, where high stiffness, weight reduction and ow tooling investment are paramount. The space frame acts as the structural &quot;skeleton&quot; to which the mechanical components and outer, visible skin panels are attached.A space frar can be constructed from a variety or combination of materials such as steel tubes, aluminum extrusions or plastic composites.</p>
<p><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/spaceframe3.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
<strong>EXTRUDED ALUMINUM</strong>
This extruded aluminum alloy space frame is welded or bonded together to form a stiff lightweight structure where much of the stress is managed by the sill sections. This type of design is ideal for mid or rear-engine cars that do not require a tunnel for driveshafts.</p>
<p><strong>COMPOSITE / CARBON FIBER</strong>
This composite or carbon fiber &quot;tub&quot; is utilized as a central component in some exotic sportscar structures. Additional metalic structures are often added to the front and rear of the tub to complete the frame. New manufacturing methods are helping to reduce high piece cost.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL or ALUMINUM TUBING</strong>
In this space frame solution, high-strength steel on aluminum alloy tubing is welded together to form. a &quot;backbone&quot;frame where most of the torsional rigidity comes from the tunnel structure.Shear panels are added to stiffen the structure and close off the floor and dash.Plastic outer panels complete the body assembly. This type of design lends itself to front-engine, RwD cars that require a tunnel for the transmission and driveshaft.</p>

<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/crashworthiness.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p>Protecting the occupants from injury is the highest priority when designing a vehicle.</p>
<p>The most stressful event that a human body will endure is a high speed crash. Meeting various government impact testing requirements and consumer-group standards provides a set of clear objectives for the structure. These tests involve the vehicle being driven into barriers at specific speeds or being hit with test devices in various zones with specific forces being applied. Afte each test, measurements are taken on the body structure and crash dummies to confirm the integrity of the design. Visit www.euroncap.com , www.lihs.org , www.safercar.gov for more information on this</p>
<p>The main passenger compartment is very rigid and is configured tc remain intact after a serious accident with little or no deformation. The front and rear structures are designed to crumple at a controlled rate to absorb energy, thereby reducing trauma to the occupants,</p>
<p>Many of the key elements of the crash structure feature frequently in the typical sections that run through the package.</p>
<p>Note that many of the main structural elements such as the sills, rails and cross members are designed to be as straight as. possible. By being straight, they can manage very high. (compression) loads efficiently along their axes.</p>
<h3 id="efficient-structures" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#efficient-structures" aria-hidden="true">#</a> EFFICIENT STRUCTURES</h3>
<p><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/efficientstructure.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
<strong>The front-end</strong> structure is designed to crush at a specific rate to absorb energ. during a high speed impact.</p>
<p>Clear crush space is created around any solid components such as the engine, transmission and steering to prevent then being pushed through the footwells, helping the vehicle to pass the frontal impact tests</p>
<p><strong>The passenger compartment</strong> is very rigid to protect the occupants from being crushed during a high speed impact or rollover. During an impact, the shape of the side apertures should be maintained to allow the doors to open as normal after an accident.</p>
<p>Lateral underfloor cross members are designed to help the structure meet side impact requirements.</p>
<p><strong>The rear end structure</strong> is designed to crush and absorb energy in similar way to the front compartment.</p>
<p>One of the main goals is to protect the fuel tank from rupture due to a high speed collision by a following vehicle.</p>
<h3 id="legislation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#legislation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> LEGISLATION</h3>
<p>Many elements in the package are controlled by legislation, none more so than the body structure and exterior features such as lighting, bumpers and license plates. Each market (country/region) has a slightly different set of rules and. guidelines, which for the most part serve to make vehicles safer. Because cars generally serve the same purpose all over the world, similar safety regulations apply everywhere..</p>
<p>Additionally, consumer groups keep customers very well informed about safety issues, so most manufacturers will look to exceed the local safety regulations to gain an advantage in the market. To sell vehicles in global markets, each product will have to meet the strictest regulations in all countries.</p>
<p>The governing bodies of the three major car-manufacturing countries/continents- USA, Europe and Japan-set most of the significant standards that automotive manufacturers strive. to meet.</p>
<p><strong>North America</strong> The Department of Transportation has an. organization called the National Highway Transportation Safety Association (NHTSA) www.nhtsa.dot.goy . They establish the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) www.fmvss.com.These govern the design of cars in the USA Canada has a similar set of standards, the Canadian Motor. Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) www.tc.gc.ca</p>
<p>These vary from the US regulations, so most American cars are designed to meet both sets of requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) www.epa.gov also sets standards to help maintain and improve the environment One significant area controlled by the EPA is the fuel consumption of various types of vehicles</p>
<p><strong>European Union (Eu)</strong> Regulations are set by the European Commission (EC).These vary from the North American regulations, mainly due to geographic and economic concerns, which lead to greater traffic density.Visit www.unece.org . Various European national governments ha. also set rules to suit the requirements of their own country. Many of these rules were carried over from an earlier era.</p>
<p>In addition to governmental legislation, organizations like the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) serve to provide impartial crashworthiness information to customers. They conduct comprehensive crash tests and report to the consumer exactly how each vehicle performed. They issue a star rating to each model and most manufacturers strive to achieve the highest &quot;5-star rating.&quot; Visit www.euroncap.com for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Japan</strong> Legislation is similar to Europe due to similar traffic-density issues However, controlling the size of vehicles to help improve parking is more. important in this market than in the other two.</p>
<p><strong>Worldwide</strong> Most other countries in the world will look to these governments. to establish their own standards.They may also use International Standard Organization (ISO) standards to help regulate products on their roads..</p>
<p>So the overall vehicle size, powertrain layout, occupant package, body architecture, exterior lighting and interior design are heavily influenced by government legislation and customer advocate groups.Although this subject is very complex, it is worth understanding the basic requirements before developing a package.</p>
<p>Looking around at vehicles that are on the road today, you can see there is a ot of uniformity, which is due mainly to legislation. As you work through this book, you will notice that various regulations are mentioned when they are significant to the design. Features like bumpers, lights, and pillars are strictly controlled, so if you are designing a concept that looks dramatically different in these areas, check the appropriate chapter for legislation</p>
<p>On the next page is a list of some major impact tests that will shape cars and trucks in the near future. These change with time, usually getting more. demanding.</p>

These tests help to create bumper systems that resist damage during low speed impacts (under 5mph) and protect adjacent components such as ights, grilles and the hood panel. The bumper heights are determined by these tests.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH SPEED (40mph) OFFSET IMPACT TEST</strong>
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/highspeedoffset.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
The most demanding test, affecting the front end and interior design. It ensures the driver and passengers can walk away from a high-speed impact. This test. most resembles a typical head-on collision which typically is slightly offset.</p>

<h3 id="materials" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#materials" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Materials</h3>
<p>Material choice may have a major affect on the package, so the basic properties of each material and manufacturing limitations should be understood.</p>
<p>As with every aspect ot advanced concept design, traditiona practices and applications should be considered before applying new technology.If the new material does not play a part in changing the exterior and interior design or create opportunities for a more efficient package, the designer may decide not to focus on the materials during the early phase o the project.</p>
<p>The type of construction methods, however, will usually influence the package, so it is always important to note how material choice may affect construction or vice versa. Below is a brief overview of some of the common materials used in body construction today.Most car bodies will be a mixture of these, to meet all of the requirements placed on them by the customers, manufacturers and legislation.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL</strong></p>
<p>Steel is an amazing and versatile material, which is why it is used so extensively in body construction. It has many properties which give it an advantage over other materials.</p>
<p>First, it is one of the cheapest materials, and although commodity prices do fluctuate, it will probably remain much cheaper than the alternatives. It is also ideal for inexpensive (piece cost), high- volume manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>It is very strong and when used in an efficient unibody type of construction it can provide a surprisingly light solution.High- strength steel alloys can also be utilized if weight takes a highe priority than cost in the product</p>
<p>It is also very ductile (formable) allowing it to be drawn into very. complex and deep panels. Most body side apertures are now. stamped in one piece from the A&quot;pillar to the rear of the vehicle, reducing complexity and tolerance issues.Steel is very easy to spot weld, having a much higher resistance to electric current than aluminum, its main competitor. Steel structures are also more durable than aluminum, which can be an advantage in truck. frames where their flexibility requires resistance to cracking.</p>
<p>In the past, a major drawback of using steel was corrosion, but with new coatings and construction methods, this is no longer ar ssue. Recycling is now an important part of automotive design, and steel's propensity to revert to its original state, (i.e. rust or ferrous oxide), makes it even more attractive. It can, of course, also be melted down and reused.</p>
<p><strong>ALUMINUM</strong></p>
<p>Aluminum alloy's strength-to-weight ratio is better than steel but often ends up requiring larger &quot;box sections&quot; or thicker panels. They are also more expensive, so usually only applied when light weight is a high priority for the product. An aluminum hood assembly, for example, may be about half the weight of a steel equivalent, but will be twice the cost</p>
<p>Although aluminum is seen as a softer material than steel, it work hardens&quot;much quicker due to its grain structure, so it is not as formable in a cold state as steel. There are, however, low production-volume manufacturing processes that require heating the material to create the desired forms</p>
<p>Aluminum sections can be extrudedwith very low investment and are often applied to lightweight, low-production-volume body structures, mainly for sports cars where light, stiff. structures are desirable.Due to its resistance to electric current it is also more difficult to spot weld, so adhesive and riveted joints are common in aluminum structures. New welding processes and adhesives are facilitating a greater mix of. aluminum and steel panels in car bodies.Like steel, it will corrode if not coated but is more resistant to oxidation.</p>
<p><strong>PLASTICS</strong></p>
<p>Plastics come in many types with various properties.Some leno themselves to high production volume manufacturing while others are only suitable for smaller production runs.</p>
<p>Thermoplastics such as polypropylene are often used when lov speed impact dent resistance is required. This is a popular. choice for bumper fascias and door exterior panels. These are. also very formable so very complex and deep sections can be easily manufactured from these materials.Several components can be manufactured in one plastic piece, like the bumper and grill, which reduces assembly complexity and can improve. design flexibility.</p>
<p>Plastics such as SMC (sheet-moulded compounds) or RIM (reaction-injection mouldings) are also often used in the manufacture of exterior panels that are fastened to space-frame structures.</p>
<p>Carbon fiber is only used on specialist applications such as. exotic, lightweight sports cars, due to the cost and labor- intensive production processes.These materials are very light strong and stiff, resulting in the size reduction or elimination ot box sections.They are often used in conjunction with other materials to make up a stiff, lightweight body.</p>

<h2 id="section-11-3-closures" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-3-closures" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.3 Closures</h2>
<p>The closures and their apertures are designed to provide access to the passenger compartment, engine bay and cargo area. The various solutions are illustrated below. Their outlines are a design. element, so breaking up the exterior panels and closures should be considered early in the process.</p>
<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/doorhingetypes.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Front Hinged Doors</strong>
This conventional layout is applied to most cars. It provides independent. closures for front and rear passengers. that are inexpensive and simple to. operate. It also requires a B pillar which. is essential for an efficient structure, side. impact and seat belt mounting. Longer. doors may have four bar-link hinges to help push the front of the door outboard in tight parking situations.</p>
<p><strong>Front &amp; Rear Hinged Doors</strong>
Occasionally applied to vehicles with a short cab or wheelbase, which reduces the rear-door length.This system is an improvement over a two door solution.Removing the B pillar improves rear foot swing and creates a large aperture which may be desirable for lifestvle vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Scissor Doors</strong>
This type of door system adds drama to the design of exotic cars but also has some practical advantages.For wide sports cars with deep sill. sections, it eliminates the problems caused by out-swinging doors in tight parking situations, improving ingress and egress.</p>
<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/doorhingetypes2.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Gull Wing Doors</strong>
Similar application and advantages as the scissor door. This system can only be applied to low vehicles because it increases the overall height with the doors open, making garage parking a problem. The inherent design geometry cuts into the roof, improving ingress ano egress into an inboard seat location,. over a tall sill section..</p>
<p><strong>Sliding Doors</strong>
Often appliedto minivans and commercial vans.Ideal for situations where an out swinging door is dangerous or impractical Sliding door systems require enough room behind the door to build in a straight, horizontal track which will carry the door to the fully opened position. These systems can be electrically operated</p>
<p><strong>Access Covers</strong>
For performance or race cars, good access to all of the powertrain and suspension components is important to allow quick adjustment to these systems Hinged or removable covers with side cut lines provide large open apertures.</p>
<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/doorhingetypes3.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Liftgate (Hatch )</strong>
The most common rear aperture closure for minivans, hatchbacks and SUVs. Providing good access from all angles and cover from rain. Also eliminates doors from opening into parking lot traffic. The backlight glass can also lift independently.Electric operation can help shorter people close the gate on vehicles with a tall roof.</p>
<p><strong>Tailgate</strong>
Used extensively on pickup trucks, tailgates are designed to remain dropped while the vehicle is in use to extend the bed floor. These are usually removable to aid loading of large heavy objects.</p>
<p><strong>Lift &amp; Swing</strong>
Often applied to vehicles that carry thei spare wheel on the rear gate, making a lift gate impractical. Sealing the two-. piece closure is more complex than a single gate.</p>
<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/doorhingetypes4.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Lift &amp; Tailgate</strong>
This split closure system provides a flexible loading solution allowing the lift glass to be opened without the cargo spilling out. It also provides an opening to improve passenger compartment airflow. The tailgate provides an. exterior seating area and extends the load floor.</p>
<p><strong>Hood &amp; Trunk/Deck Lid</strong>
Used mostly on commercial applications. The double doors are designed to be used individually or together. They are often designed to open to 180 or 270 degrees to provide  easy access from the side</p>
<p><strong>Rear Swing Doors</strong>
For most cars, a simple hood and trun lid provide access to the engine bay and rear cargo area. Cut lines should be designed as far outboard as possible to create wide apertures. &quot;Clamshell' hoods have cut lines on the side and help to protect pedestrians from injury.</p>
<h2 id="side-doors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#side-doors" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SIDE DOORS</h2>
<p>The doors set up the body side design. They are attached to the body structure by hinges or rollers and latched into position. This separation allows them to be made of different materials from the structure, such as aluminum and plastics, creating the opportunity to make them lighter or dent resistant.</p>
<p>The three types of door construction shown below are typic to most production cars and trucks.Choosing a type of doc system will depend on the various derivatives that are being considered for the vehicle range-i.e., sedan, coupe, convertible, wagon, etc.Keeping the same door system for every vehicle will reduce investment.Cost, appearance and head clearance may also affect the choice</p>

<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/aperturedesign.png" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p>The door apertures will have a major influence on the exterior design. Some basic parameters need to be addressed before the design concept moves forward too far. Definitely, door feasibility should be very advanced before the full-size clay model is started. The size and shape of the door apertures will be affected by the following considerations:</p>
<p><strong>Roof Rail</strong>
Helps to add torsional rigidity to the body. The seals should be at least 760mm above the H-point to provide head swing</p>
<p><strong>Rear Roof Rail</strong>
Similar design constraints as over the front door aperture.</p>
<p><strong>A Pillar Upper</strong>
Designed to resist roof crush during rollover. It's section needs to meet visibility requirements.</p>
<p><strong>A Pillar Lower</strong>
A major component in the front end structure. It forms part of the front wheel opening and is also used to mount the front door hinges. The driver's foot should be set up to allow for easy foot swing past the door and seats.</p>
<p><strong>B Pillar Upper</strong>
Helps to support the roof during rollover It is located behind the driver's eye point.The front seat belts are attached to this structure.</p>
<p><strong>B Pillar Lower</strong>
Pushed forwards to improve rear foot swing. It is an integrated part of the structure for side impact. Door hinges and latching require room for mounting and additional reinforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Sill</strong>
Designed to resist compression during high speed frontal impact, helping to maintain the passenger compartment shape. The top of the section is kept as low as possible to improve the step over.</p>
<h3 id="closure-perimeter-cut-lines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#closure-perimeter-cut-lines" aria-hidden="true">#</a> CLOSURE PERIMETER &quot;CUT LINES'</h3>
<p>Closure cut lines refer to the external panel gaps around the hinged or articulating panels, such as: doors, hoods or trunk lids. They can be an important design element and if they are not considered at an early stage of design, they may end up looking untidy or awkward. Their location and shape are driven by several factors:</p>
<p><strong>Ingress, Egress &amp; Access</strong>
The main tunction tor the closure is to allow people or objects to pass through an aperture, so this will be a primary driver for the cut line location. See side door aperture design on the previous page for reference</p>
<p><strong>Hinging, Swing and Articulation</strong>
The hinge axis location and orientation or path of the closur assembly (sliding doors) will have a great influence on the shape of the cut lines.For doors that swing, the surface. profile swung into the open position is often used to help. determine the cut-line shape adjacent to the hinges. Sliding doors travel in the direction of the tracks and need to have openings that are sympathetic to the door travel path at the start of their motion</p>
<p><strong>Structure</strong>
The body structure will also influence the design of the. cut lines. Often the door boundaries will fall inside the. aperture structure as it tracks around the wheel openings sills and roof rails. In some cases the door's outer surface may overlap the structure to clean up the exterior design or simplify tolerances between the doors and body panels.</p>
<p><strong>Exterior Design</strong>
The relative location of the upper-body structure (pillars) and the wheel-house openings will have a dramatic effeq on the cut-line shape. The examples on the opposite page show how these elements, in conjunction with the occupant location, will affect the door perimeter design.</p>
<p>Additionally, the hood, trunk lid and tailgate boundaries may coincide with other elements on the exterior such as glass panels, lamps, and grills.Pay particular attention to the corners of the windshield and backlight glass.Their design will affect the adjacent panel shapes, often influencing the closure boundaries. It is easier to keep the cut lines tidy if the corners of the glass panels are sharp and do not have large radii.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/cutline1.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p>The examples above illustrate how different the side door cut lines can be on a similar vehicle. Example 1 shows the door perimeters within the structure. This allows the structural box. sections to be fully optimized,which is always helpful in small vehicles. The smaller upper door frame is especially helpful to. improve head clearance to the roof-rail structure.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/cutline2.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Example 2 shows the doors overlapping the sills, root rails ar rear wheel house (&quot;dog leg) structure. This solution cleans up the design and reduces the number of visible elements in side view. It also simplifies the door gap tolerancing and helps to keep the door apertures clean, which is important in luxury cars and off-road vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>CONVENTIONAL HINGING</strong>
Setting up the cut lines adjacent to the hinge axis line is more of a geometry exercise than a design study.Note how the cut line in side view sympathizes with the end-view, bodyside surface contour. The front edge of the door will swing in toward the structure unless the hinges are mounted on the exterior surface</p>
<p><strong>UNCONVENTIONAL HINGING</strong>
In this example the horizontal hinge axis in the roof allows design freedom for the side cut lines, notably at the front..</p>
<p><strong>FRAMELESS TWO DOORS</strong>
One small detail to note with this type of door is that the rear cut line. will usually curve rearward just below the belt to provide room for latch and drop glass packaging.</p>
<p><strong>EXPOSED STRUCTURES</strong>
Sometimes the door cut lines will follow the body structure to optimize the box sections and communicate strength in the exterior design.</p>
<p><strong>LARGE TWO DOORS</strong>
Large two-door cars need long doors to help break up their proportions.The approximate length of the door should be less than 1400mm to reduce stress on the hinges and minimize the outward swing of the door design.</p>

<p><strong>REARWARDA PILLARS</strong>
In this example, the A pillar is pulled rearward in relation to the driver to improve cornering visibility.The front cut lines step forward to improve foot swing.</p>
<p><strong>COMMERCIAL VEHICLES</strong>
To optimize the vehicle length, the driver is often pushed forward in th package. To improve foot swing, the forward cut line will track around the wheel house. This is only possible with a high floor structure. Note the straight, vertical cut line at the front of the sliding cargo door. This. is not possible with a conventional swinging door unless the rear door. is hinged from the rear.</p>
<p><strong>CAB FORWARD</strong>
Here the A pillar is pulled forward so the door cut has to depart from the pillar and cut through it to fall behind the front wheel-house structure.</p>
<p><strong>FORWARD CONTROL</strong>
Forward control vehicles are becoming rare in most markets because. of frontal impact issues. One thing to consider on the front door cut is allowing space for the driver's feet to pass between the A pillar and. front wheelhouse structure.</p>
<h3 id="foot-swing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#foot-swing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FOOT SWING</h3>
<p>The relationship of the driver's foot and the front tire can be very influential to the package and exterior design. For some vehicles. this relationship is critical; for others, the two elements are independent of each other. The five examples on the next two. pages show various vehicles with significantly different architectures. Note that in each package the relationship between the foot and the tire O.D. (outside diameter) is different, and this is. also reflected in the location of the windshield to the front spindle and the overall front-end silhouette From a designer's perspective, it is very difficult and time consuming to get this relationship fully optimized without spending a lot of time on research and development.</p>
<p>If your concept calls tor a close relationship ot the toot and tir in side view, find an existing vehicle with an efficient package and a similar lateral relationship of the driver and front track, and benchmark it. Tire turn (turn circle) may need to be considered here, as well as the size of the pillar structure. The A-pillar lower section is the cornerstone of the body structure, and along with the driver foot swing, simply cannot be compromised.</p>
<p>The illustration below shows how the seat, the door trim and the A-pillar trim need adequate clearance, allowing the drivers. to swing their feet through the opening..</p>

This rear-wheel-drive car has a longitudinal engine and the front. wheel is located for optimum weight distribution creating a long 'dash to axle&quot; proportion. The relationship of the driver's foot to the tire is. not an issue in this type of architecture</p>
<p><strong>ECONOMY CAR</strong> FRONT, TRANSVERSE ENGINE FWD
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/footswingeconomy.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
A typical front-wheel drive vehicle with a transverse engine places a high. priority on package efficiency. The driver is pushed as far forward as possible. in the wheelbase to create a spacious interior in a very short overall length. In this type of architecture, it is very important not to push the driver too close tc the tire or it will create an ingress/egress issue. Although the main issue here. appears to be a potential clash between the driver or foot pedals and front. wheel house, the actual problem is the foot swing past the A-pillar structure. which is rearward of the wheel opening as shown on the previous page..</p>
<p><strong>EXOTIC SPORTS CAR</strong> MID, LONGITUDINAL ENGINE - RWD
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/footswingexoticsportscar.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
This exotic mid-engine sports car packages the foot forward of the tire O.D. There are several elements in this architecture that make it possible.The first is a wide track which pushes the tire outboard for greater stability and handling.. Next, the driver may be located inboard to reduce the width of the greenhouse which reduces drag and the polar moment. This is the opposite of the previous example where the vehicle is narrow and the driver is pushed outboard for. interior space efficiency. Lastly, the exotic sports-car owner will be more orgiving of poor ingress and egress if the package improves performance.. An unorthodox door opening may also improve the situation..

<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/footswingvans.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This van has a very tall driver height and posture. This situation is more forgiving than the previous front wheel drive car example because the A-pill.. structure can be moved forward above the step-in area, optimizing the foot. swing. This demonstrates how a tall driver package can help to create a. space-efficient architecture ideal for cargo, passenger or recreational vans.</p>

<p>This example shows a forward-control driver package.Thes rare today because frontal impact regulations and expectati have become more demanding.Here the driver requires enough room to pass between the wheel house and the open door trim as he steps into the cab and swings into the seat. This ultimately pushes the driver quite a long way forward of the front spindle, leaving the feet vulnerable during a collision or the front overhang is extended.</p>
<h3 id="door-and-door-aperture-design" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#door-and-door-aperture-design" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DOOR AND DOOR APERTURE DESIGN</h3>
<p>The door apertures are developed through about nine typical. body sections. These are cut through the pillars, roof rails and sill at critical areas such as the hinge and latch locations.</p>
<p>An &quot;X&quot; section through the H-point is used to set up the body- side profile through the roof rails, drop glass, door inner/outer. panels and the sill structure. This is a very important section in. the early stages of the package development.</p>
<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/doorxsection.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p>Particular attention is given to the drop glass. Working in conjunction with the side view DLOs (daylight openings), the end-view section is developed to set up the tumblehome (angle of the glass) along the upper-body side (greenhouse) and the profile of the door outer panels</p>
<p>Door seals are usually mounted over the weld flanges on the box sections around the apertures, creating a clean, soft. opening. The openings created by the weld flanges are often. referred to as the P1 &amp; P2 curves.</p>
<p>The illustrations on the next page show how the drop glass. and glass perimeters (daylight openings) are designed to clear the door hardware.</p>
<p>This hardware includes hinges, latches, side intrusion beams and the door inner panels. Note how the mirror flag on the front and the rear door fixed glass help to reduce the size of the dropping glasses and allow them to track down at an advantageous angle.</p>

<p>Below is a basic outline of the pillar obscuration geometry studies,. illustrating how the pillar structure and trim are designed to meet specific obscuration parameters. These are usually set up in a computer system. Most designers will never have to execute these studies, but need to. understand that there are limitations on the size and location of the A pillars. The main objective for the A-pillar design is to create a strong. enough structure to meet roof crush targets but make it easy to see aroul it. A full description of the geometry and eye points (E1, E2, E3 &amp; E4) set. can be found in the 77/649/ EC directive and SAE J1050 recommendatic</p>

<figure><img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/rearwardvisibility.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, the design is usually guided by customer requirements and how comfortable they are driving with compromised rearward vision. Backup cameras and sensors are providing a greater sense of security for cars with challenging rear aperture designs.</p>
<p>Most of the requirements or recommendations concern the rearview mirror. The illustration below. shows the requirement to be able to see the road within 60 meters of the rear of the vehicle. The sections at the right and bottom illustrate how up, down and side-to-side vision angles are generated from the reflected eye points forward of the interior mirror.</p>
<p><strong>SEDAN</strong>
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/rearvissedan.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
Typically the sedan backlight aperture does not present a problem at the header because it is lifted by the rear headroom requirements.

<p><strong>COUPE &amp; FASTBACK</strong>
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/rearviscoupe.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
Coupes and fastbacks may have a problem with the rear header height due to the desire for a low roof, which often leads to compromised rear headroom.Notice in the section that the rear header is forward of the occupant's head. This is a common condition,. putting the head under the glass, improving clearance.Visibility over the deck lid may be worse than the sedan because the driver eye point is often lower to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>HATCHBACK &amp; SUVs</strong>
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/rearvishatch.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
Hatchbacks and utility vehicles do not usually have an issue with rear visibility becaus the roof height is often tall and there is no deck lid. The rear header structure is much larger than the other cars because of the lift gate frame and hinge packaging. Occasionally, on SUVs, the spare tire is mounted on the rear swing gate which may obscure the rear view.</p>
<p><strong>PICKUP TRUCKS</strong>

<p>Building the vehicle architecture with sections is fundamental to the process for both construction and communication. As a concept develops these will become more and more complex The typical section example on the following page illustrates how complex the final body assembly can be.Each section is developed by several specialists. In the case of this sill sectior structural analysts will determine the cross-sectional areas of the box section, its material specifications,thickness and topology.The manufacturing group will determine the panels assembly sequence, flange lengths (for spot welding) and the shape requirements for forming. Other elements that may influence the section design are included in the detail drawing.</p>
<p>this ensures that consideration is always given to the adjacent components.Additional information may also be added to put the section in context with the package. In this case, ground. clearance, step-over requirements and side-impact test-barrier heights are included. The studio engineering group will construc. the section initially and work with the design team to create the exterior and interior profiles</p>
<p>From the designer's perspective, the basic criteria for each. section needs to be understood because this will influence the exterior form. In this case, the sill height may be governed by. ground clearance, step-over or floor-height requirements</p>

<h2 id="section-11-6-aerodynamics-basics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-6-aerodynamics-basics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.6 Aerodynamics Basics</h2>
<p>Aerodynamics is a very complex subject and needs a grea deal more attention than this book can provide. However, as with other technical subjects, there are some basic principles that can be applied to help the vehicle meet its functional objectives. In the case of aerodynamics, each package should be set up to allow the vehicle to travel through the air as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>First, look at the importance that aerodynamics will play in the type of vehicle you are designing.A sports car with a high top speed, superior handling and cooling requirements will have a greater emphasis put on airflow and down force.</p>
<p>Trucks, on the other hand, are usually an aerodynamic disaster, with every aspect of their exterior surface working against good aerodynamic principles.</p>
<p>Two factors to consider are the drag coefficient (Cd) and the total drag.The drag coefficient is a factor that defines the &quot;slipperiness&quot; of a particular shape, regardless of its scale. The total drag multiplies this coefficient by the cross sectional area (A) of the vehicle to determine its aerodynamic resistance (force) that must be overcome to propel it (CdA) A full-size car and its quarter scale model will have the same drag coefficient, but the full-size car will have sixteen times the total drag of the quarter-scale model.</p>
<p>From the vehicle-architecture perspective, making the vehicle smaller in the front view should always be considereq. if low aerodynamic drag is a priority. Down force should also. be a consideration.With most vehicles expected to be driven at 70mph or more, keeping more air pressure on top of the vehicle than underneath will help maintain handling characteristics regardless of speed.For high-speed cars it is also critical that the balance of the car is not affected by speed; spoilers are often applied to help maintain consistent down force on the front and rear tires.</p>
<h3 id="breathing-apertures" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#breathing-apertures" aria-hidden="true">#</a> BREATHING APERTURES</h3>
<p>Additionally, vehicles need to breathe to perform several different functions. Engine cooling requires a substantial airflow through the cooling modules or radiators..</p>
<p>The breathing apertures that allow this airflow are usually very evident in the styling of most cars and trucks. The size of the body opening for the engine is usually about two-thirds the size of the cooling module (radiator).Openings in the front of the car for brake cooling are also common, with ducting to the brake rotors on high-performance cars. The heating, ventilatio &amp; air conditioning (HVAC) system usually takes air in through the &quot;cowl screen&quot; at the base of the windshield</p>
<p>The outside air enters the car at this low pressure area and travel through the plenum chamber to remove moisture and other large particles.The plenum chamber often serves as part of the body structure and runs across the base of the windshield between the A pillars. Some very high-performance cars may require unique ram-air vents to push more air into the engine induction system.</p>
<p>Other factors like wind-noise reduction and water removal are nigh considerations in luxury cars, but these are often addressec with localized surface contours and hardware details, which will not affect the package.</p>

<strong>GOOD</strong>
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/aerogood.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy">
Being small, low and narrow, this car is already set up for reduced drag. Additionally, the low front, gently contoured roof line, sides tapered in toward the rear, a sharp rear cut-off creating minimal turbulence, and fared-in rear wheels further contribute to low drag coefficient.</p>
<p><strong>BAD</strong>
<img src="@source/posts/img/chapter_11/aerobad.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>This SUV is an aerodynamic nightmare. With the large, high and wide body, the vehicle above will have to push a lot of air out of the way as it travels at speed. The other features on the body will disrupt the airflow, creating additional drag,particularly the abrupt changes of body shape and untidy underside.</p>
<h2 id="section-11-7-lighting-basics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-7-lighting-basics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.7 Lighting Basics</h2>
<p>The lights are an important safety feature,so their design is strictly controlled by legislation in all markets. This aspect of vehicle design can be quite complicateo. so it is advisable to get a good basic understanding of. the purpose and function of each light first, then learn the specific details later.</p>
<p>Each light serves a specific function, either to illuminate the road at night, to make the vehicle visible in the dark or bad weather, or to communicate to other drivers wha the vehicle is about to do, i.e., stop, turn or back up.</p>
<p>The size and location of each light will depend on. illumination targets or specific surface-area. requirements set out in the legislations of different parts of the world. European lighting legislation differs, for. instance, from US requirements.</p>
<p>The headlights are designed to pass various tests and their size will depend on the technology applied.. whereas most of the other lights and reflectors need to meet minimum lens surface-area, visibility and position requirements.</p>
<p>In the US the requirements are set out in the SAE Lighting Standards Manual and FMvss 108. In Europe the regulation are set by the ECE. For installation location and use, see ECE-R 48. For all other design specifications check the various ECE regulations specific to each type of lamp. Each lamp is made from three components: the bulb, reflector. and lens. Some assemblies occupy large volumes and need to be considered early in the package. process. Additionally, because they are a safety item they need to be protected and their relationship to th bumper systems is an important element in the exterior design.</p>
<p>Widespread adoption of light-emitting diode (LED) technology is changing the approach to the. engineering design of lamps. This is giving designers new opportunities for the shape and appearance of lighting, although the positioning of the lamps remains regulated. Laser lighting technologies are also emerging to add to the mix of options available. to designers and engineers.</p>

<p>The US and Canadian governments both require passenger car (trucks are exempt) bumpers to meet low-speed impact tests The tests range from speeds of 2.5mph to 5mph and aim to minimize damage caused in minor accidents. The requirements differ slightly for each country, but essentially call for the front and rear bumper systems to protect the adjacent areas from damage, especially the safety items such as lights To ensure that each vehicle complies with the requirement, the car is hit by a steel “pendulum”at 405mm and 508mm above the ground as shown in this illustration.</p>

<p>This is applied at centerline and at the corners. To pass the tests the bumper profile is offset from the surrounding surfaces. To set up the bumper offsets, benchmark existing cars to get the ideal or minimum condition. Offsets will vary depending on the vehicle weight and the cost of the bumper system, so always compare similar types of cars.Getting the bumper offsets to look good and meet the impact tests is usually a challenge to a design team.</p>

<p>The relationship of the body and underbody components to the ground should be appropriate to the use of the vehicle.Road-going passenger cars are set up to be driven without contact to the ground when fully loaded. Off-road vehicles will need to be raised according to their intended capability, which may also include being driven through water. Some sports cars can be designed. with compromised ground clearance to improve aerodynamics, but the owners will need to accept the limitations of their vehicle. in some situations</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum ground clearance dimensions shown are set by various governments to determine that the vehicle is suitable for off-road use.

<li>These angles are quite low and are examples taken from typical products at curb attitude. Some specialty sports cars may be lower.

<h2 id="section-11-10-glazing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-10-glazing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.10 Glazing</h2>
<p>The main objectives for the glass panels are to protect the occupants and allow them to see out. In many cases, they also articulate to provide ventilation or access. Glass is one of the oldest materials used in vehicle design and is still manufactured using traditional processes, which can limit the design of each panel. The main reason it is still used extensively is because of its optical qualities and hardness (scratch resistance), unlike some plastics. This makes it ideal for applications where it contacts. other abrasive components, such as windshield wipers and belt moldings. Two types of glass are used, laminated (for windshields) and toughened (for side glass and backlights).</p>
<p>The laminated glass is thicker, usually5-6mm, and is therefore quite heavy but will not shatter when struck, unlike the tempered glass which is usually about 3mm thick and designed to shatter into small pieces on impact.</p>
<p>Ihe main objective for the windshield is to get the optics as clear and free from distortion as possible.The more aggressive the installation angle, the greater the potential is for distortion. Most exotic sports-car glass is quite flat to counter this. Side-view curvature is usually kept to a minimum, but plan-view curvature is common, especially on vehicles with more upright windshields.</p>

<p>The section shows how a typical glass aperture is configured.Each aperture is surrounded by a box section, and the glass is mounted on the spot weld flange, in a rebate and held in place with adhesive or rubber molding.A blackout, or frit, is painted around the perimeter to hide the adhesive and interior trim. The main thing to note here is the distance between the edge of glass on the exterior surface and the. daylight opening&quot; (DLO) on the frit. Because of this, the section has to be designed before accurate vision studies can be completed and. the edge of glass set up.</p>

<h2 id="section-11-11-license-plates" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-11-license-plates" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.11 License Plates</h2>
<p>License plates are required in all markets and their requirements differ significantly from market to market. Often they are left as an afterthought in the design process, which can lead to problems due to their size ocation and lighting requirements.Front license plates can be the most problematic for designers because they often need to be placed in the grill, spoiling the appearance of the vehicle's face. They can also block airflow to the cooling module if located in the wrong position.</p>
<p>Vehicles sold across several markets will have a license pocket to accommodate the largest plates in all dimensions or make separate panels for each market. European plates are the widest (520mm), and US plates are the tallest (152mm), so a minimum pocket size of 520mm x 152mm will work in all situations.</p>
