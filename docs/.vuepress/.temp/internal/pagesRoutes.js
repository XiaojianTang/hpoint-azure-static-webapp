You will be working with a mindset that the vehicle needs to be. designed to look a certain way for the customer to accept it.

This refers more to the occupant package than the interior systems. The main objective is to set up the driver and passengers to be comfortable and safe, then create an envelope around them and use key reference data within their geometries to set up the rest of the vehicle package.
