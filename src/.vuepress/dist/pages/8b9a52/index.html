system, which threads throughout the architecture, holding all the elements together. The package is developed in a series of sections cut through the body structure and doors.&quot;</p></blockquote><h1 id="section-11-1-introduction-to-bodies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-1-introduction-to-bodies" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.1 Introduction to Bodies</h1><p>The body is one of the most complex assemblies of a passenger vehicle, consuming a large portion of a project&#39;s resources, both manpower and investment. Besides being a complex piece of engineering, it is alsc the element most tied to the vehicle&#39;s overall architecture and its appearance. The body structure and outer skin have four main functions:</p><p><strong>1. Protect the occupants and cargo</strong><strong>2. Provide attachment points for all other major components and manage the stress between them</strong><strong>3. Provide an appealing appearance and image for the product.</strong><strong>4. Provide an aerodynamic torm to improve performance and reduce wind noise.</strong></p><p>A car or truck body can be broken down into three main groups ot assemblies, namely: the underbody, upper body and closures. The underbody consists mainly of the floor panels and dash structure which are stiffened by a number of box sections to form a substructure. These box sections comprise the main longitudinal frame rails, the sills and the cross members. The powertrain and chassis components are attached to this. substructure which also serves as the primary crash structure, running out to the extremities of the body.</p><p>The upper body can be thought of as a framework surrounding a series of apertures and supporting the outer skin of the vehicle. Each aperture or opening is designed to provide access into the vehicle or visibility out of it.</p><p>The closures include the doors, hood, and trunk lid/tailgate These represent a large portion of the exterior surface and feature extensively in the early packaging studies..</p><p>The combination of box sections and &quot;shear&quot; panels serve to meet the four functional requirements listed on the previous page. The bulk of the work is done by the box sections (or beams) that are designed to withstand the enormous stresses that a vehicle will endure throughout its life. The design of the beams (pillars, sills, rails, cross members, etc.) are developed in a series of typical sections which are strategically cut through the main structure.The path and size (cross-sectional area and material thickness) of each section is determined by a structural analyst. He or she will use computer applications to ensure the body meets all of the requirements for torsional stiffness, durability, vibrational frequency and weight. The illustration on the opposite page shows a very primitive load path diagram which may be used to set up the structure. The bodies of nearly all mass-produced cars, minivans, trucks and SUVs are made from stamped steel although this migh change as weight reduction becomes more and more important to increase energy efficiency.Some premium vehicles substitute steel for pressed aluminum and, in som cases. extruded aluminum sections</p><p>In addition to the box sections, contoured panels (floor, dash roof, wheel houses, etc.) close off the structure, creating a weatherproof and fireproof compartment for the passengers and cargo. These and some of the glazing panels also add tq the structural integrity of the body and manage shear loads</p><p>The closures such as the hood, trunk lid and tailgate do not. add much to the dynamic structure, but they can play a majo role in crash protection. These are often made from materials that differ from the main structure (such as plastic) to reduce weight or provide attributes such as dent resistance while improving formability.</p><p>Bumper or fascia panels are usually made from damage. resistant plastics to meet low-speed impact requirements which are mandatory in many markets.Plastics can also be formed to shapes that are difficult to create in metal. It also allows several components such as grills, lamp housings,. scoops and badges to be made in one part, helping to redu. complexity and assembly time</p><p>The remaining exterior panels serve only to create an appealing, aerodynamic exterior form. The other exterior features and components such as glass, lighting, breathing apertures and license-plate pockets all need to be considered in the development of the body and its typical sections</p><h3 id="load-path" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#load-path" aria-hidden="true">#</a> LOAD PATH</h3><p>This simple node diagram is created around the package by the structural analysts. The main load inputs from the suspension mounts and crash systems create the major load paths which thread through the body. From this the required cross-sectional areas of the main box sections are calculated These sections feature prominently in the vehicle package. Each box section or structural panel may be subiect to one or more of the forces shown below</p><figure><img src="/assets/loadpath-OadTBHS-.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="types-of-body-construction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-body-construction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TYPES OF BODY CONSTRUCTION</h3><p><strong>UNIBODY</strong></p><figure><img src="/assets/unibody1-o8-wikO0.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>The most efficient and cost-effective type of construction process for mass-produced cars, minivans and SUVs The structure is made from steel or aluminum panels 0.7-2.0mm thick).The panels are stamped into shape and then spot welded together to form a series of box sections and contoured panels.

SUVs, helping to manage heavy loads and drive over rough terrain. It. also provides strength for increased towing capacity. The powertrain,. suspension and main body are all mounted separately to a high-. strength frame on rubber isolators to improve the ride quality, noise and vibration. Significant drawbacks of this type of structure are increased weight, higher floor height and poor torsional rigidity, which is importani for good handling and road holding..</p><p><img src="/assets/bodyonframe2-wsvOJF6Y.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> A high-strength steel truck frame that supports the unitary cab and bed assemblies mounted on top.

Meeting various government impact testing requirements and consumer-group standards provides a set of clear objectives for the structure. These tests involve the vehicle being driven into barriers at specific speeds or being hit with test devices in various zones with specific forces being applied. Afte each test, measurements are taken on the body structure and crash dummies to confirm the integrity of the design.

Each market (country/region) has a slightly different set of rules and. guidelines, which for the most part serve to make vehicles safer. Because cars generally serve the same purpose all over the world, similar safety regulations apply everywhere..</p><p>Additionally, consumer groups keep customers very well informed about safety issues, so most manufacturers will look to exceed the local safety regulations to gain an advantage in the market. To sell vehicles in global markets, each product will have to meet the strictest regulations in all countries.</p><p>The governing bodies of the three major car-manufacturing countries/continents- USA, Europe and Japan-set most of the significant standards that automotive manufacturers strive. to meet.</p><p><strong>North America</strong> The Department of Transportation has an. organization called the National Highway Transportation Safety Association (NHTSA) www.nhtsa.dot.goy . They establish the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) www.fmvss.com.These govern the design of cars in the USA Canada has a similar set of standards, the Canadian Motor. Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS) www.tc.gc.ca</p><p>These vary from the US regulations, so most American cars are designed to meet both sets of requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) www.epa.gov also sets standards to help maintain and improve the environment One significant area controlled by the EPA is the fuel consumption of various types of vehicles</p><p><strong>European Union (Eu)</strong> Regulations are set by the European Commission (EC).These vary from the North American regulations, mainly due to geographic and economic concerns, which lead to greater traffic density.Visit www.unece.org . Various European national governments ha. also set rules to suit the requirements of their own country. Many of these rules were carried over from an earlier era.</p><p>In addition to governmental legislation, organizations like the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) serve to provide impartial crashworthiness information to customers. They conduct comprehensive crash tests and report to the consumer exactly how each vehicle performed. They issue a star rating to each model and most manufacturers strive to achieve the highest &quot;5-star rating.&quot; Visit www.euroncap.com for more information.</p><p><strong>Japan</strong> Legislation is similar to Europe due to similar traffic-density issues However, controlling the size of vehicles to help improve parking is more. important in this market than in the other two.</p><p><strong>Worldwide</strong> Most other countries in the world will look to these governments. to establish their own standards.They may also use International Standard Organization (ISO) standards to help regulate products on their roads..</p><p>So the overall vehicle size, powertrain layout, occupant package, body architecture, exterior lighting and interior design are heavily influenced by government legislation and customer advocate groups.Although this subject is very complex, it is worth understanding the basic requirements before developing a package.</p><p>Looking around at vehicles that are on the road today, you can see there is a ot of uniformity, which is due mainly to legislation. As you work through this book, you will notice that various regulations are mentioned when they are significant to the design. Features like bumpers, lights, and pillars are strictly controlled, so if you are designing a concept that looks dramatically different in these areas, check the appropriate chapter for legislation</p><p>On the next page is a list of some major impact tests that will shape cars and trucks in the near future. These change with time, usually getting more. demanding.</p><h3 id="crash-tests-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#crash-tests-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> CRASH TESTS EXAMPLES</h3><p><strong>ROOF CRUSHTEST (4 Times the Vehicle Weight)</strong><img src="/assets/roofcrush-_4ewqRsi.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> This test ensures that the structure will protect the occupants in the event of a rollover.

Below is a brief overview of some of the common materials used in body construction today.Most car bodies will be a mixture of these, to meet all of the requirements placed on them by the customers, manufacturers and legislation.</p><p><strong>STEEL</strong></p><p>Steel is an amazing and versatile material, which is why it is used so extensively in body construction. It has many properties which give it an advantage over other materials.</p><p>First, it is one of the cheapest materials, and although commodity prices do fluctuate, it will probably remain much cheaper than the alternatives. It is also ideal for inexpensive (piece cost), high- volume manufacturing processes.</p><p>It is very strong and when used in an efficient unibody type of construction it can provide a surprisingly light solution.High- strength steel alloys can also be utilized if weight takes a highe priority than cost in the product</p><p>It is also very ductile (formable) allowing it to be drawn into very. complex and deep panels. Most body side apertures are now. stamped in one piece from the A&quot;pillar to the rear of the vehicle, reducing complexity and tolerance issues.Steel is very easy to spot weld, having a much higher resistance to electric current than aluminum, its main competitor. Steel structures are also more durable than aluminum, which can be an advantage in truck. frames where their flexibility requires resistance to cracking.</p><p>In the past, a major drawback of using steel was corrosion, but with new coatings and construction methods, this is no longer ar ssue. Recycling is now an important part of automotive design, and steel&#39;s propensity to revert to its original state, (i.e. rust or ferrous oxide), makes it even more attractive. It can, of course, also be melted down and reused.</p><p><strong>ALUMINUM</strong></p><p>Aluminum alloy&#39;s strength-to-weight ratio is better than steel but often ends up requiring larger &quot;box sections&quot; or thicker panels. They are also more expensive, so usually only applied when light weight is a high priority for the product. An aluminum hood assembly, for example, may be about half the weight of a steel equivalent, but will be twice the cost</p><p>Although aluminum is seen as a softer material than steel, it work hardens&quot;much quicker due to its grain structure, so it is not as formable in a cold state as steel. There are, however, low production-volume manufacturing processes that require heating the material to create the desired forms</p><p>Aluminum sections can be extrudedwith very low investment and are often applied to lightweight, low-production-volume body structures, mainly for sports cars where light, stiff. structures are desirable.Due to its resistance to electric current it is also more difficult to spot weld, so adhesive and riveted joints are common in aluminum structures. New welding processes and adhesives are facilitating a greater mix of. aluminum and steel panels in car bodies.Like steel, it will corrode if not coated but is more resistant to oxidation.</p><p><strong>PLASTICS</strong></p><p>Plastics come in many types with various properties.Some leno themselves to high production volume manufacturing while others are only suitable for smaller production runs.</p><p>Thermoplastics such as polypropylene are often used when lov speed impact dent resistance is required. This is a popular. choice for bumper fascias and door exterior panels. These are. also very formable so very complex and deep sections can be easily manufactured from these materials.Several components can be manufactured in one plastic piece, like the bumper and grill, which reduces assembly complexity and can improve. design flexibility.</p><p>Plastics such as SMC (sheet-moulded compounds) or RIM (reaction-injection mouldings) are also often used in the manufacture of exterior panels that are fastened to space-frame structures.</p><p>Carbon fiber is only used on specialist applications such as. exotic, lightweight sports cars, due to the cost and labor- intensive production processes.These materials are very light strong and stiff, resulting in the size reduction or elimination ot box sections.They are often used in conjunction with other materials to make up a stiff, lightweight body.</p><h3 id="material-application-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#material-application-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> MATERIAL APPLICATION EXAMPLES</h3><p>**Section Through the Front Bumper and Hood ** Illustrating some of the various materials used in body and exterior trim components.</p><figure><img src="/assets/frbumpersection-8m12XcYA.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="typical-sill-sections" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#typical-sill-sections" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TYPICAL SILL SECTIONS</h3><p>These two sill sections illustrate how various materials and manufacturing processes can be applied to a similar area of the body, affecting a key area of the package.</p><p><strong>Stamped, spot welded steel panels</strong>, part of a unibody structure. <img src="/assets/stampsection-hEY3aI1-.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"><img src="/assets/stampframe-GGxKyiV4.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>Extruded aluminum sillsection</strong>,part of a light weight space-frame structure.</p><p><img src="/assets/extrudealumisection-byVslnt8.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"><img src="/assets/alumibody-JHPCuDPC.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><h2 id="section-11-3-closures" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-3-closures" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.3 Closures</h2><p>The closures and their apertures are designed to provide access to the passenger compartment, engine bay and cargo area. The various solutions are illustrated below. Their outlines are a design. element, so breaking up the exterior panels and closures should be considered early in the process.</p><figure><img src="/assets/doorhingetypes-p0yHap9N.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Front Hinged Doors</strong> This conventional layout is applied to most cars. It provides independent. closures for front and rear passengers. that are inexpensive and simple to. operate. It also requires a B pillar which. is essential for an efficient structure, side. impact and seat belt mounting. Longer. doors may have four bar-link hinges to help push the front of the door outboard in tight parking situations.</p><p><strong>Front &amp; Rear Hinged Doors</strong> Occasionally applied to vehicles with a short cab or wheelbase, which reduces the rear-door length.This system is an improvement over a two door solution.Removing the B pillar improves rear foot swing and creates a large aperture which may be desirable for lifestvle vehicles.</p><p><strong>Scissor Doors</strong> This type of door system adds drama to the design of exotic cars but also has some practical advantages.For wide sports cars with deep sill. sections, it eliminates the problems caused by out-swinging doors in tight parking situations, improving ingress and egress.</p><figure><img src="/assets/doorhingetypes2-yx954Vr6.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Gull Wing Doors</strong> Similar application and advantages as the scissor door. This system can only be applied to low vehicles because it increases the overall height with the doors open, making garage parking a problem. The inherent design geometry cuts into the roof, improving ingress ano egress into an inboard seat location,. over a tall sill section..</p><p><strong>Sliding Doors</strong> Often appliedto minivans and commercial vans.Ideal for situations where an out swinging door is dangerous or impractical Sliding door systems require enough room behind the door to build in a straight, horizontal track which will carry the door to the fully opened position. These systems can be electrically operated</p><p><strong>Access Covers</strong> For performance or race cars, good access to all of the powertrain and suspension components is important to allow quick adjustment to these systems Hinged or removable covers with side cut lines provide large open apertures.</p><figure><img src="/assets/doorhingetypes3-Rp-UWYY5.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Liftgate (Hatch )</strong> The most common rear aperture closure for minivans, hatchbacks and SUVs. Providing good access from all angles and cover from rain. Also eliminates doors from opening into parking lot traffic. The backlight glass can also lift independently.Electric operation can help shorter people close the gate on vehicles with a tall roof.</p><p><strong>Tailgate</strong> Used extensively on pickup trucks, tailgates are designed to remain dropped while the vehicle is in use to extend the bed floor. These are usually removable to aid loading of large heavy objects.</p><p><strong>Lift &amp; Swing</strong> Often applied to vehicles that carry thei spare wheel on the rear gate, making a lift gate impractical. Sealing the two-. piece closure is more complex than a single gate.</p><figure><img src="/assets/doorhingetypes4-KZEzpivf.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Lift &amp; Tailgate</strong> This split closure system provides a flexible loading solution allowing the lift glass to be opened without the cargo spilling out. It also provides an opening to improve passenger compartment airflow. The tailgate provides an. exterior seating area and extends the load floor.</p><p><strong>Hood &amp; Trunk/Deck Lid</strong> Used mostly on commercial applications. The double doors are designed to be used individually or together. They are often designed to open to 180 or 270 degrees to provide easy access from the side</p><p><strong>Rear Swing Doors</strong> For most cars, a simple hood and trun lid provide access to the engine bay and rear cargo area. Cut lines should be designed as far outboard as possible to create wide apertures. &quot;Clamshell&#39; hoods have cut lines on the side and help to protect pedestrians from injury.</p><h2 id="side-doors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#side-doors" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SIDE DOORS</h2><p>The doors set up the body side design. They are attached to the body structure by hinges or rollers and latched into position. This separation allows them to be made of different materials from the structure, such as aluminum and plastics, creating the opportunity to make them lighter or dent resistant.</p><p>The three types of door construction shown below are typic to most production cars and trucks.Choosing a type of doc system will depend on the various derivatives that are being considered for the vehicle range-i.e., sedan, coupe, convertible, wagon, etc.Keeping the same door system for every vehicle will reduce investment.Cost, appearance and head clearance may also affect the choice</p><figure><img src="/assets/sidedoors-lROpNkMG.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="body-side-aperture-design-criteria" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#body-side-aperture-design-criteria" aria-hidden="true">#</a> BODY SIDE APERTURE DESIGN CRITERIA</h3><figure><img src="/assets/aperturedesign-nhhLYXHt.png" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>The door apertures will have a major influence on the exterior design. Some basic parameters need to be addressed before the design concept moves forward too far. Definitely, door feasibility should be very advanced before the full-size clay model is started. The size and shape of the door apertures will be affected by the following considerations:</p><p><strong>Roof Rail</strong> Helps to add torsional rigidity to the body. The seals should be at least 760mm above the H-point to provide head swing</p><p><strong>Rear Roof Rail</strong> Similar design constraints as over the front door aperture.</p><p><strong>A Pillar Upper</strong> Designed to resist roof crush during rollover. It&#39;s section needs to meet visibility requirements.</p><p><strong>A Pillar Lower</strong> A major component in the front end structure. It forms part of the front wheel opening and is also used to mount the front door hinges. The driver&#39;s foot should be set up to allow for easy foot swing past the door and seats.</p><p><strong>B Pillar Upper</strong> Helps to support the roof during rollover It is located behind the driver&#39;s eye point.The front seat belts are attached to this structure.</p><p><strong>B Pillar Lower</strong> Pushed forwards to improve rear foot swing. It is an integrated part of the structure for side impact. Door hinges and latching require room for mounting and additional reinforcement.</p><p><strong>Sill</strong> Designed to resist compression during high speed frontal impact, helping to maintain the passenger compartment shape. The top of the section is kept as low as possible to improve the step over.</p><h3 id="closure-perimeter-cut-lines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#closure-perimeter-cut-lines" aria-hidden="true">#</a> CLOSURE PERIMETER &quot;CUT LINES&#39;</h3><p>Closure cut lines refer to the external panel gaps around the hinged or articulating panels, such as: doors, hoods or trunk lids. They can be an important design element and if they are not considered at an early stage of design, they may end up looking untidy or awkward. Their location and shape are driven by several factors:</p><p><strong>Ingress, Egress &amp; Access</strong> The main tunction tor the closure is to allow people or objects to pass through an aperture, so this will be a primary driver for the cut line location. See side door aperture design on the previous page for reference</p><p><strong>Hinging, Swing and Articulation</strong> The hinge axis location and orientation or path of the closur assembly (sliding doors) will have a great influence on the shape of the cut lines.For doors that swing, the surface. profile swung into the open position is often used to help. determine the cut-line shape adjacent to the hinges. Sliding doors travel in the direction of the tracks and need to have openings that are sympathetic to the door travel path at the start of their motion</p><p><strong>Structure</strong> The body structure will also influence the design of the. cut lines. Often the door boundaries will fall inside the. aperture structure as it tracks around the wheel openings sills and roof rails. In some cases the door&#39;s outer surface may overlap the structure to clean up the exterior design or simplify tolerances between the doors and body panels.</p><p><strong>Exterior Design</strong> The relative location of the upper-body structure (pillars) and the wheel-house openings will have a dramatic effeq on the cut-line shape. The examples on the opposite page show how these elements, in conjunction with the occupant location, will affect the door perimeter design.</p><p>Additionally, the hood, trunk lid and tailgate boundaries may coincide with other elements on the exterior such as glass panels, lamps, and grills.Pay particular attention to the corners of the windshield and backlight glass.Their design will affect the adjacent panel shapes, often influencing the closure boundaries. It is easier to keep the cut lines tidy if the corners of the glass panels are sharp and do not have large radii.</p><h3 id="side-door-cut-lines" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#side-door-cut-lines" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SIDE DOOR CUT LINES</h3><p><strong>Example 1</strong></p><figure><img src="/assets/cutline1-7ihNNSOG.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>The examples above illustrate how different the side door cut lines can be on a similar vehicle. Example 1 shows the door perimeters within the structure. This allows the structural box. sections to be fully optimized,which is always helpful in small vehicles. The smaller upper door frame is especially helpful to. improve head clearance to the roof-rail structure.</p><p><strong>Example 2</strong><img src="/assets/cutline2-StQQYHgf.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p>Example 2 shows the doors overlapping the sills, root rails ar rear wheel house (&quot;dog leg) structure. This solution cleans up the design and reduces the number of visible elements in side view. It also simplifies the door gap tolerancing and helps to keep the door apertures clean, which is important in luxury cars and off-road vehicles.</p><figure><img src="/assets/cutline3-VZzfb7OA.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>CONVENTIONAL HINGING</strong> Setting up the cut lines adjacent to the hinge axis line is more of a geometry exercise than a design study.Note how the cut line in side view sympathizes with the end-view, bodyside surface contour. The front edge of the door will swing in toward the structure unless the hinges are mounted on the exterior surface</p><p><strong>UNCONVENTIONAL HINGING</strong> In this example the horizontal hinge axis in the roof allows design freedom for the side cut lines, notably at the front..</p><p><strong>FRAMELESS TWO DOORS</strong> One small detail to note with this type of door is that the rear cut line. will usually curve rearward just below the belt to provide room for latch and drop glass packaging.</p><p><strong>EXPOSED STRUCTURES</strong> Sometimes the door cut lines will follow the body structure to optimize the box sections and communicate strength in the exterior design.</p><p><strong>LARGE TWO DOORS</strong> Large two-door cars need long doors to help break up their proportions.The approximate length of the door should be less than 1400mm to reduce stress on the hinges and minimize the outward swing of the door design.</p><figure><img src="/assets/cutline4-Et2v4PJN.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>REARWARDA PILLARS</strong> In this example, the A pillar is pulled rearward in relation to the driver to improve cornering visibility.The front cut lines step forward to improve foot swing.</p><p><strong>COMMERCIAL VEHICLES</strong> To optimize the vehicle length, the driver is often pushed forward in th package. To improve foot swing, the forward cut line will track around the wheel house. This is only possible with a high floor structure. Note the straight, vertical cut line at the front of the sliding cargo door. This. is not possible with a conventional swinging door unless the rear door. is hinged from the rear.</p><p><strong>CAB FORWARD</strong> Here the A pillar is pulled forward so the door cut has to depart from the pillar and cut through it to fall behind the front wheel-house structure.</p><p><strong>FORWARD CONTROL</strong> Forward control vehicles are becoming rare in most markets because. of frontal impact issues. One thing to consider on the front door cut is allowing space for the driver&#39;s feet to pass between the A pillar and. front wheelhouse structure.</p><h3 id="foot-swing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#foot-swing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FOOT SWING</h3><p>The relationship of the driver&#39;s foot and the front tire can be very influential to the package and exterior design. For some vehicles. this relationship is critical; for others, the two elements are independent of each other. The five examples on the next two. pages show various vehicles with significantly different architectures. Note that in each package the relationship between the foot and the tire O.D. (outside diameter) is different, and this is. also reflected in the location of the windshield to the front spindle and the overall front-end silhouette From a designer&#39;s perspective, it is very difficult and time consuming to get this relationship fully optimized without spending a lot of time on research and development.</p><p>If your concept calls tor a close relationship ot the toot and tir in side view, find an existing vehicle with an efficient package and a similar lateral relationship of the driver and front track, and benchmark it. Tire turn (turn circle) may need to be considered here, as well as the size of the pillar structure. The A-pillar lower section is the cornerstone of the body structure, and along with the driver foot swing, simply cannot be compromised.</p><p>The illustration below shows how the seat, the door trim and the A-pillar trim need adequate clearance, allowing the drivers. to swing their feet through the opening..</p><figure><img src="/assets/footswing-fpRE7jE8.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="foot-swing-cont" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#foot-swing-cont" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FOOT SWING Cont.</h3><p><strong>LUXURY SEDAN</strong> FRONT, LONGITUDINAL ENGINE - RWD <img src="/assets/footswingsedan-kYHeKoUL.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> This rear-wheel-drive car has a longitudinal engine and the front. wheel is located for optimum weight distribution creating a long &#39;dash to axle&quot; proportion. The relationship of the driver&#39;s foot to the tire is. not an issue in this type of architecture</p><p><strong>ECONOMY CAR</strong> FRONT, TRANSVERSE ENGINE FWD <img src="/assets/footswingeconomy-dNxvQvWc.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> A typical front-wheel drive vehicle with a transverse engine places a high. priority on package efficiency. The driver is pushed as far forward as possible. in the wheelbase to create a spacious interior in a very short overall length. In this type of architecture, it is very important not to push the driver too close tc the tire or it will create an ingress/egress issue. Although the main issue here. appears to be a potential clash between the driver or foot pedals and front. wheel house, the actual problem is the foot swing past the A-pillar structure. which is rearward of the wheel opening as shown on the previous page..</p><p><strong>EXOTIC SPORTS CAR</strong> MID, LONGITUDINAL ENGINE - RWD <img src="/assets/footswingexoticsportscar-FzZmdsjG.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> This exotic mid-engine sports car packages the foot forward of the tire O.D. There are several elements in this architecture that make it possible.The first is a wide track which pushes the tire outboard for greater stability and handling.. Next, the driver may be located inboard to reduce the width of the greenhouse which reduces drag and the polar moment. This is the opposite of the previous example where the vehicle is narrow and the driver is pushed outboard for. interior space efficiency. Lastly, the exotic sports-car owner will be more orgiving of poor ingress and egress if the package improves performance.. An unorthodox door opening may also improve the situation.. H-PoINT | Bodies &amp; Exterior Trim</p><p><strong>COMMERCIAL/PASSENGER VANS</strong> FRONT-TRANSVERSE ENGINE-FWD <img src="/assets/footswingvans-WxQISi49.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p>This van has a very tall driver height and posture. This situation is more forgiving than the previous front wheel drive car example because the A-pill.. structure can be moved forward above the step-in area, optimizing the foot. swing. This demonstrates how a tall driver package can help to create a. space-efficient architecture ideal for cargo, passenger or recreational vans.</p><p><strong>COMMERCIAL /PASSENGER VANS</strong> FORWARD CONTROL - RWD <img src="/assets/footswingminivans-jQghax1h.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p>This example shows a forward-control driver package.Thes rare today because frontal impact regulations and expectati have become more demanding.Here the driver requires enough room to pass between the wheel house and the open door trim as he steps into the cab and swings into the seat. This ultimately pushes the driver quite a long way forward of the front spindle, leaving the feet vulnerable during a collision or the front overhang is extended.</p><h3 id="door-and-door-aperture-design" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#door-and-door-aperture-design" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DOOR AND DOOR APERTURE DESIGN</h3><p>The door apertures are developed through about nine typical. body sections. These are cut through the pillars, roof rails and sill at critical areas such as the hinge and latch locations.</p><p>An &quot;X&quot; section through the H-point is used to set up the body- side profile through the roof rails, drop glass, door inner/outer. panels and the sill structure. This is a very important section in. the early stages of the package development.</p><figure><img src="/assets/doorxsection-pEDD-RGW.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>Particular attention is given to the drop glass. Working in conjunction with the side view DLOs (daylight openings), the end-view section is developed to set up the tumblehome (angle of the glass) along the upper-body side (greenhouse) and the profile of the door outer panels</p><p>Door seals are usually mounted over the weld flanges on the box sections around the apertures, creating a clean, soft. opening. The openings created by the weld flanges are often. referred to as the P1 &amp; P2 curves.</p><p>The illustrations on the next page show how the drop glass. and glass perimeters (daylight openings) are designed to clear the door hardware.</p><p>This hardware includes hinges, latches, side intrusion beams and the door inner panels. Note how the mirror flag on the front and the rear door fixed glass help to reduce the size of the dropping glasses and allow them to track down at an advantageous angle.</p><figure><img src="/assets/doorsections-SCIcwq0V.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="side-glass-surfacing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#side-glass-surfacing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SIDE GLASS SURFACING</h3><p>The glass surtace must lie on a cylinder or a barrel surtace.This allows the dropping glass panel to slide down the run channels and between the belt molding without binding.

Backup cameras and sensors are providing a greater sense of security for cars with challenging rear aperture designs.</p><p>Most of the requirements or recommendations concern the rearview mirror. The illustration below. shows the requirement to be able to see the road within 60 meters of the rear of the vehicle.

This is a common condition,. putting the head under the glass, improving clearance.Visibility over the deck lid may be worse than the sedan because the driver eye point is often lower to the ground.</p><p><strong>HATCHBACK &amp; SUVs</strong><img src="/assets/rearvishatch-t16aCsWI.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> Hatchbacks and utility vehicles do not usually have an issue with rear visibility becaus the roof height is often tall and there is no deck lid. The rear header structure is much larger than the other cars because of the lift gate frame and hinge packaging. Occasionally, on SUVs, the spare tire is mounted on the rear swing gate which may obscure the rear view.</p><p><strong>PICKUP TRUCKS</strong><img src="/assets/rearvispickup-P2KBQ6wX.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> Iruck rearward visibility is rarely an issue.Most trucks are fitted with large exterior mirrors because the cargo in the bed often obscures the view through the backlight.

However, as with other technical subjects, there are some basic principles that can be applied to help the vehicle meet its functional objectives. In the case of aerodynamics, each package should be set up to allow the vehicle to travel through the air as efficiently as possible.</p><p>First, look at the importance that aerodynamics will play in the type of vehicle you are designing.A sports car with a high top speed, superior handling and cooling requirements will have a greater emphasis put on airflow and down force.</p><p>Trucks, on the other hand, are usually an aerodynamic disaster, with every aspect of their exterior surface working against good aerodynamic principles.</p><p>Two factors to consider are the drag coefficient (Cd) and the total drag.The drag coefficient is a factor that defines the &quot;slipperiness&quot; of a particular shape, regardless of its scale. The total drag multiplies this coefficient by the cross sectional area (A) of the vehicle to determine its aerodynamic resistance (force) that must be overcome to propel it (CdA) A full-size car and its quarter scale model will have the same drag coefficient, but the full-size car will have sixteen times the total drag of the quarter-scale model.</p><p>From the vehicle-architecture perspective, making the vehicle smaller in the front view should always be considereq. if low aerodynamic drag is a priority. Down force should also. be a consideration.With most vehicles expected to be driven at 70mph or more, keeping more air pressure on top of the vehicle than underneath will help maintain handling characteristics regardless of speed.For high-speed cars it is also critical that the balance of the car is not affected by speed; spoilers are often applied to help maintain consistent down force on the front and rear tires.</p><h3 id="breathing-apertures" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#breathing-apertures" aria-hidden="true">#</a> BREATHING APERTURES</h3><p>Additionally, vehicles need to breathe to perform several different functions. Engine cooling requires a substantial airflow through the cooling modules or radiators..</p><p>The breathing apertures that allow this airflow are usually very evident in the styling of most cars and trucks. The size of the body opening for the engine is usually about two-thirds the size of the cooling module (radiator).Openings in the front of the car for brake cooling are also common, with ducting to the brake rotors on high-performance cars. The heating, ventilatio &amp; air conditioning (HVAC) system usually takes air in through the &quot;cowl screen&quot; at the base of the windshield</p><p>The outside air enters the car at this low pressure area and travel through the plenum chamber to remove moisture and other large particles.The plenum chamber often serves as part of the body structure and runs across the base of the windshield between the A pillars. Some very high-performance cars may require unique ram-air vents to push more air into the engine induction system.</p><p>Other factors like wind-noise reduction and water removal are nigh considerations in luxury cars, but these are often addressec with localized surface contours and hardware details, which will not affect the package.</p><figure><img src="/assets/breathingapertures-G5jShWNc.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="exterior-shapes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exterior-shapes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> EXTERIOR SHAPES</h3><p>These two illustrations show some of the fundamental do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of packaging to create good aerodynamics. <strong>GOOD</strong><img src="/assets/aerogood-2DGlSKS3.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"> Being small, low and narrow, this car is already set up for reduced drag. Additionally, the low front, gently contoured roof line, sides tapered in toward the rear, a sharp rear cut-off creating minimal turbulence, and fared-in rear wheels further contribute to low drag coefficient.</p><p><strong>BAD</strong><img src="/assets/aerobad-3XCk-Mt6.jpg" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p>This SUV is an aerodynamic nightmare. With the large, high and wide body, the vehicle above will have to push a lot of air out of the way as it travels at speed. The other features on the body will disrupt the airflow, creating additional drag,particularly the abrupt changes of body shape and untidy underside.</p><h2 id="section-11-7-lighting-basics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-7-lighting-basics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11.7 Lighting Basics</h2><p>The lights are an important safety feature,so their design is strictly controlled by legislation in all markets. This aspect of vehicle design can be quite complicateo. so it is advisable to get a good basic understanding of. the purpose and function of each light first, then learn the specific details later.</p><p>Each light serves a specific function, either to illuminate the road at night, to make the vehicle visible in the dark or bad weather, or to communicate to other drivers wha the vehicle is about to do, i.e., stop, turn or back up.</p><p>The size and location of each light will depend on. illumination targets or specific surface-area. requirements set out in the legislations of different parts of the world. European lighting legislation differs, for. instance, from US requirements.</p><p>The headlights are designed to pass various tests and their size will depend on the technology applied.. whereas most of the other lights and reflectors need to meet minimum lens surface-area, visibility and position requirements.</p><p>In the US the requirements are set out in the SAE Lighting Standards Manual and FMvss 108. In Europe the regulation are set by the ECE. For installation location and use, see ECE-R 48. For all other design specifications check the various ECE regulations specific to each type of lamp. Each lamp is made from three components: the bulb, reflector. and lens. Some assemblies occupy large volumes and need to be considered early in the package. process. Additionally, because they are a safety item they need to be protected and their relationship to th bumper systems is an important element in the exterior design.</p><p>Widespread adoption of light-emitting diode (LED) technology is changing the approach to the. engineering design of lamps. This is giving designers new opportunities for the shape and appearance of lighting, although the positioning of the lamps remains regulated. Laser lighting technologies are also emerging to add to the mix of options available. to designers and engineers.</p><h3 id="typical-section-through-generic-headlamp" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#typical-section-through-generic-headlamp" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TYPICAL SECTION THROUGH GENERIC HEADLAMP</h3><p>This section illustrates the various components in a typical headlamp assembly.

In many cases, they also articulate to provide ventilation or access. Glass is one of the oldest materials used in vehicle design and is still manufactured using traditional processes, which can limit the design of each panel. The main reason it is still used extensively is because of its optical qualities and hardness (scratch resistance), unlike some plastics. This makes it ideal for applications where it contacts. other abrasive components, such as windshield wipers and belt moldings. Two types of glass are used, laminated (for windshields) and toughened (for side glass and backlights).</p><p>The laminated glass is thicker, usually5-6mm, and is therefore quite heavy but will not shatter when struck, unlike the tempered glass which is usually about 3mm thick and designed to shatter into small pieces on impact.</p><p>Ihe main objective for the windshield is to get the optics as clear and free from distortion as possible.The more aggressive the installation angle, the greater the potential is for distortion. Most exotic sports-car glass is quite flat to counter this. Side-view curvature is usually kept to a minimum, but plan-view curvature is common, especially on vehicles with more upright windshields.</p><figure><img src="/assets/glazing-pL_SzRp1.jpg" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="fixed-glazing-aperture-section" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fixed-glazing-aperture-section" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FIXED GLAZING APERTURE SECTION</h3><p>The section shows how a typical glass aperture is configured.Each aperture is surrounded by a box section, and the glass is mounted on the spot weld flange, in a rebate and held in place with adhesive or rubber molding.A blackout, or frit, is painted around the perimeter to hide the adhesive and interior trim.
