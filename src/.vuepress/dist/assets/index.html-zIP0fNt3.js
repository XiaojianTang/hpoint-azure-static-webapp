The market segments are set up by function and the vehicle architecture is designed to meet the needs of the customers, manufacturers andthe environment.</p><h2 id="section-3-1-introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-1-introduction" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3.1 Introduction</h2><p>A design team is only given one chance to start a project. One of the biggest mistakes they can make is not to consider the functional objectives of their concept in enough depth early enough in the life of the project</p><p>Every product must serve a purpose for its customer and manufacturer. These need to be thought through really well before the first line is drawn on the package or design. At fir it may feel that focusing on this aspect of the process wil grind a project to a halt, but the truth is the functional objectives are going to make each team member stop and think about what they are doing and approach the design with a fresh perspective.</p><p>The best approach is to start with all the right questions and not necessarily the answers.Every so often the auto industry. goes through a revolution, often brought about by advances in technology,economic pressure, ecology or political issues</p><p>Three main areas need to be considered when setting out the objectives for the project: the customer, the manufacturer, and. the market or environment.See page 69 for more details.</p><p>Ihese will drive the basic architecture of the project, and technology will make it work. The customer will usually have. special needs that the vehicle should meet. These may be physical or emotional. The customer demographics and lifestyle should be examined very carefully. It will be difficult t understand why some elements in the architecture are desirable to a certain customer. Classic examples of this are people who drive off-road vehicles but never go off-road, or buy a pickup truck but never carry a load in the bed.There is obviously something else about the architecture that attracts these buyers.</p><h3 id="setting-clear-objectives" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setting-clear-objectives" aria-hidden="true">#</a> SETTING CLEAR OBJECTIVES</h3><p>The environment or market the customer lives in will have a great effect on the design, which may be influenced by the climate, terrain, infrastructure, economy, or legislation. This is significant because any given customer will need a different vehicle depending on their geographical location.</p><p>Ideally, the manufacturer&#39;s limiting parameters should remain unnoticed by the customer. The overwhelming fact remains that automobiles are very complicated to build and require a massive investment of capital, so taking care of business will be a primary consideration for any successful designer. This often involves working within many constraints, including a budget,. timing schedule and developing a concept that is feasible for manufacture that fits into a long range strategy.. Making compromises is always difficult. The section illustrated below shows a typical &quot;fastback&quot; coupe rear head environmen. which is clearly not good.Deciding how much to compromise the headroom to achieve desirable exterior proportions is a decision that the design team and product planninq will need to make toqether.</p><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="compromise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compromise" aria-hidden="true">#</a> COMPROMISE</h3><p>Most specialist cars, by nature, perform well in one aspect at. the expense of another. Some functional objectives can be. polarizing leading to tension within the design team, making it even more important to be very clear about prioritizing them.If each team member clearly understands the functional objectives, difficult decisions will be easier to rationalize.</p><p>Interpreting this intormation is largely the responsibility ot the studio engineers. Their job is to understand the physical and emotional needs of the customer, and convert them into architecture using the most appropriate technology. They also need to understand the limitations of the intended markets ang the business model of the manufacturer.Finally, they have to b able to communicate this clearly to the rest of the design team</p><p>The considerations described on the next page represent the factors that will influence the design of a car or truck.Not all of these apply to every vehicle but they should be thought through before crossing them off the list.</p><p>These examples ot current production car rear occupant head environments are often the cause of tension within a design. team. Clearly the headroom dimensions illustrated are not. good, but are typical in many 2+2 sports coupes and SUVs. For. the packaging and styling teams to agree on an acceptable roof profile, the concept objectives and competitive market examples need to be clearly understood</p><figure><img src="'+n+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Typical production vehicles with compromised rear occupant environments</figcaption></figure><h3 id="requirement-subjects-to-consider" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#requirement-subjects-to-consider" aria-hidden="true">#</a> REQUIREMENT SUBJECTS TO CONSIDER</h3><p>The lists below contains the key factors that should be considered before the functional objectives are set up.</p><p><strong>CUSTOMER FOCUSED ATTRIBUTES</strong></p><p><strong>cost . image . size . interior space . cargo volume . number of passengers . economy . weight . handling . speed . flexibility . comfort . durability . off-road capability . trim level . security . colors . noise/vibration/harshshness (NVH) . emissions . towing capacity . customizing potential . loading capacity . aftermarket component availability . easy ingress/egress . maneuverability . range . sound . power . safety/crashworthiness . brand identity . command-of-the-road seating</strong></p><p><strong>MANUFACTURER&#39;S CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p><p><strong>manufacturing capability . manufacturing costs . product lineup . platform sharing strategy . derivatives . production volumes . dealer network . marketing strategy . manpower . paint . available components &amp; systems . warranty .

This is because most countries have specific legislation for each vehicle category, which can affect design decisions.</p><p>This legislation might range from specific design criteria and taxation policies to use limitations and emissions standards.</p><p>For a variety of reasons, most governments want to control the types of vehicles that use their nation&#39;s infrastructure. In addition, there are many other organizations that have vested interests in classifying vehicles. Consumer groups need to test and compare cars and trucks and organize their data Insurance companies need to assess the risk for different types of products. Local authorities may apply operating limits on certain types of vehicles</p><figure><img src="'+l+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>The vehicle design can be affected by factors that range from crash requirements and overall dimensional. limitations, to the number of wheels and lighting. specifications. Taxation classes are often determined by. engine size and power output but may also be affected by overall size, value and the number of wheels.</p><p>Use regulations are usuallyset up to permit vehicles with specific functions to excel in their duties</p><p>A good example is the off-road vehicle, which USA regulations allow to be designed without the same bumper regulations that apply to cars. This enables then to achieve good approach and departure angles in extreme off-road conditions.Neighborhood electric vehicles are allowed to drive on the main roads without passing 40mph crash regulations. This helps to reduce their size, weight and cost, effectively reducing their fuel consumption and emissions</p><figure><img src="'+d+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="micro-cars" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#micro-cars" aria-hidden="true">#</a> MICRO CARS</h3><figure><img src="'+p+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>This is the smallest type of passenger car allowed to drive on all roads.
