The first approach may be purely emotional. You may have already decided that the concept wil be large or small, high or low, have a short or a long hood. You will be working with a mindset that the vehicle needs to be. designed to look a certain way for the customer to accept it. If. this is the case, the package can often be designed under the skin, because there will be nothing revolutionary about it. It is taking what we already know today and simply refining it. This is a case of the package being lead by the design.</p><p>Another approach may be driven by a specific requirement to meet dimensional legislation or market segmentation.This combined with a challenging set of functional objectives may require some innovative packaging to fit everything into a limited envelope.</p><p>The final methodology is to start only with the functional objectives. This involves research into advanced technology</p><p>to develop innovative solutions betore building the package around the occupants and new kinds of componentry.The exterior proportions can define the forms around this fresh architecture. If some of the functional objectives for the vehicle are to fit into a small footprint and be fuel efficient, then a fully optimized package will develop. If the customer requirements call for a much larger vehicle with an emphasis on making a statement with its size, then the package can b relaxed in some areas</p><p>The Function&amp; MarketSegments chapter gave an insight int some of the factors that set up the proportions.As always, th occupant package will have a major influence on the vehicle&#39;s size but the powertrain and cargo are often the elements that define the proportions of the main &quot;boxes.&quot; If a car is of the three-box layout with a long hood, or long dash-to-axle relationship (front wheel set well forward of the A pillar), there is a good chance that it is a luxury car with a large engine.</p><h3 id="proportions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#proportions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> PROPORTIONS</h3><p>There may not be a great deal of emphasis on larger cargo space, but room for suitcases and golf clubs might be an mportant requirement.A smaller, two-box hatchback will be a more efficient and versatile design with a smaller engine, but larger cargo environment for carrying bulkier objects</p><p>Proportions are always going to relate to the function of the vehicle. This may be an obvious statement but every time a. new project is kicked off, the design team should fully. investigate what opportunity there is for the architecture of the vehicle to make an exciting statement about its intended function.Similarly,the designers can consider how new technology could be applied and how that might lead to a redistribution of the masses</p><p>New advanced propulsion systems are very different in their size, proportion and arrangement to conventional internal combustion engines, so a concept that employs an electric powertrain may not look the same as one with a conventional internal combustion engine.</p><p>The three sports cars (shown right) may have similar objectives but look totally different because their engines are in different Iocations. Performance cars vary a great deal in appearance for this reason. The top car has a large mid-front engine which creates a long hood, pushing the driver towards the rear of the wheelbase.</p><p>The middle car is a mid-rear engine layout with the transaxle behind the engine. This package creates a longer rear end, pushing the rear wheel away from the driver.</p><p>The bottom car has a rear-mounted engine which requires a lot of mass behind the rear wheels but does allow a small amount of room for rear passengers</p><p><strong>FRONT ENGINE</strong><img src="'+s+'" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>MID ENGINE</strong><img src="'+h+'" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>REAR ENGINE</strong><img src="'+c+'" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><h3 id="proportionsand-body-types" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#proportionsand-body-types" aria-hidden="true">#</a> PROPORTIONSAND BODY TYPES</h3><p>The side-view proportions of the body are influenced by the occupants, cargo and powertrain packages.Additionally, the ground clearance, crash systems and aerodynamics wi affect the profile.

In fact, to maintain the flow of ideas, worrying about the vehicle&#39;s accurate size should be a low priority. After the initial ideation phase is complete and the concept possibilities are edited down, the next step is to determine the size of the vehicle.</p><p>Looking at the vehicle outline below, there is no way of understanding its scale. Only when the rest of the package elements are added to the drawing, can the size be developed, understood and communicated.The main element of the architecture that wil accurately determine size and proportions are the occupants, as shown on the following page</p><p><strong>HOW BIG IS THIS VEHICLE?</strong><img src="'+f+'" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p>Looking at the these three vehicles, notice that the outlines are exactly the same, but with the occupants set up in the basic package it is easy to understand their relative sizes.</p><p>The manikins are a consistent component in each package so the outlines of a concept can be set up around the driver and passengers&#39; geometry and spacial requirements.

This can be seen in the vehicle segmentation matrix on page 111..</p><p>Slzelsrelatlve,soltyouareworking onasmallcarlnEuropeo Japan it will be much smaller than a small car in the USA. The type of vehicle will also make a difference. A small truck, for example, will be much longer than a small car, van or SUV. The market&#39;s view of size is constantly changing. Notice (on the opposite page) the size of the original Mini &amp; Fiat 500 is much smaller than the current models. Cars have grown considerably in recent years in both size and weight. In some markets, legislation will set a mixture of dimensional, functional, weight or power-output divisior ines. These are usually there to help reduce vehicle size in regions with a dense population or for economical and environmental reasons.</p><p>Because some vehicles need to be contigured a certain way to perform their intended function, they will be exempt from some. limitations.Some divisions are mandated and strictly enforced,.</p><p>others are encouraged with tax incentives or penalties. Countries with poor economies, limited oil resources and/or. high population densities, will have stricter limitations..</p><p>An example is the designation for passenger cars and light trucks.Passenger cars have to meet stricter fuel consumption limits than trucks and their bumper design is governed by low-speed impact requirements. To be classified as a truck, the vehicle has to be either primarily designed to carry cargo, carry 9 or more people behind the driver, have an open bed or be designed for off-road use. Much of this criteria is open to interpretation, allowing som vehicles to be classified in either cateaory.</p><p>Before starting the project, try to understand the objectives from the customer, brand and environmental perspective. Look at the size of competitive vehicles and the cars and trucks in the showroom of the brand.Check all local egislation and think about how the environment and climate may affect the vehicle&#39;s architecture and classification.</p><h3 id="vehicle-size-examples" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vehicle-size-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VEHICLE SIZE EXAMPLES</h3><figure><img src="'+v+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="vehicle-segmentation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vehicle-segmentation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VEHICLE SEGMENTATION</h3><figure><img src="'+w+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>Vehicle segmentation can be broken up by several factors including: weight, size,. function, cost and speed.
