The occupants directly or indirectly influence every aspect of the vehicle&#39;s design. It is often said that cars and trucks should be designed from the inside out. This refers more to the occupant package than the interior systems. The main objective is to set up the driver and passengers to be comfortable and safe, then create an envelope around them and use key reference data within their geometries to set up the rest of the vehicle package. The most important reference point in the package is the driver&#39;s hip or H point.</p><p>This may be shown in several locations in the package drawings (because of seat adjustment) but the primary location is referred to as the Seating Reference Point or SgRP. Almost every element of the package will be influenced by its location and if modified, the effects may be seen throughout the vehicle. Each car company will use several manikins that suit their purpose. One of the most popular occupant packaging tools is the SAE 95th percentile male manikin, which is ideal for setting up the initial interior space, ensuring that the vast majority of the global population will fit into the occupant package envelope.</p><figure><img src="'+o+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>population percentiles</figcaption></figure><h3 id="geometry-of-the-95th-percentile-male-driver" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#geometry-of-the-95th-percentile-male-driver" aria-hidden="true">#</a> GEOMETRY OF THE 95TH PERCENTILE MALE DRIVER</h3><p>The SAE has worked with various groups to establish. anthropomorphic (size, proportion and movement) data which represent the volumes occupied by drivers and passengers as they sit and operate vehicles. The results of this data have been converted into sets of geometry that represents the stature of a 95th percentile US male (97.5% of the total US population,. including females) sitting in a car seat.</p><p>This geometry can be used to set up the interior systems, locate controls, execute vision studies, position the powertrain establish the wheel/tire package and even determine the bumper beams locations</p><p>The limbs, torso and head of the population sample are. measured individually to create a manikin that is built from 95th percentile male parts.The sitting manikin can be utilized in two halves, from the H-point to the feet (to establish leg room and seat height) and from the H-point to the head (to set up the head environment)</p><p>Aftertheinitialpackagehasbeen built,othersmaller manikins (5th percentile female and 50th male) are used to ensure that. smaller people will be able to drive in comfort and safety..</p><figure><img src="'+i+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="anatomy-of-the-sae-j826-95th-percentile-male-driver-mankin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#anatomy-of-the-sae-j826-95th-percentile-male-driver-mankin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> ANATOMY OF THE SAE(J826) 95th PERCENTILE MALE DRIVER MANKIN</h3><p>The height variation limited by the accommodation curve only applies to passenger cars and light trucks. Other vehicles such as golf carts, NEVs, and delivery trucks, which are designed for easy ingress/egress and short-distance driving, may require a taller seating posture. In these cases the H-point-to-heel vertical dimension may be as high as 530mm. This also often applies to Class B vehicles (heavy trucks) which usually have 150mm of vertical seat travel to accommodate shorter drivers.

Notice how the knee angle is quite different to the driver and their feet are flat on the floor. The demographics for the rear occupants may be different to the front occupants. They may be children q people who are shorter in stature to the driver, so headroom, for example, may be less.Lastly, the function of the rear compartment will often be quite different to the front, so space may be needed for reclining passengers, swiveling or stowing. seats, video monitor viewing, etc. These will all affect the spacia requirements and H point location.

Often smaller manikins will be included in the drawings to determine what size (percentile) person will fit comfortably in the rear compartment, but the 95th. percentile male manikin should be shown to communicate how the space relates to other vehicles. As always, it&#39;s important to benchmark existing products to help determing how much the key dimensions can be reduced.</p><p>Some creative packaging is often required to increase the rear headroom. For example, the rear header structure may be shifted away from the passenger&#39;s head to improve the head environment, but this will affect exterior glass boundary styling.For cars with a lift gate, the rear header structure will be larger to accommodate the closure panels and hinges and also provide additional strength. It is not unusual to package the rear head forms under the glass to optimize the available space.</p><h3 id="rear-occupants-four-door-cars" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rear-occupants-four-door-cars" aria-hidden="true">#</a> REAR OCCUPANTS - FOUR DOOR CARS</h3><p>Compromise is usually unacceptable in the rear compartment of four door family passenger cars.</p><figure><img src="'+p+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>Generally the headroom will be no less than 985mm and the couple distance on the smallest cars will be a least 750mm. As the car gets larger, the headroom wil increase a small amount but shouldn&#39;t be unnecessarily large because a high roof will increase drag and raise the center of gravity. The car may get wider and provide more hip and shoulder room and also accommodate a fifth passenger, but again the width needs to be controlled to the right dimension to minimize drag, weight and ease of parking.</p><p>The couple is usually the most noticeable dimension change as larger cars are designed to offer more comfort and space for the rear passengers. This is particularly important in luxury cars that may be chauffeur driven and the owner or customer rides in the rear.</p><p>In smaller sedans, toot swing past the base ot the B Pillar is often tight and needs to be evaluated as the. body side apertures are designed. This issue goes. away with a longer couple distance as the seat is pushed further away from the B Pillar.</p><h3 id="rear-occupants-sport-utility-vehicles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rear-occupants-sport-utility-vehicles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> REAR OCCUPANTS - SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES</h3><p>The rear occupant expectations may be similar to sedans but the packaging will be quite different. First of all the H points will be higher from the ground ang the seat height (H point to Heel) will often be taller. Additionally, the head room may be higher to provided extra clearance for the occupants bouncing while driving. on rough terrain. Usually at least 1010+ mm is required.. Often the wheelbase of the SUV will be short to improve the ramp over angle and the suspension travel (jounce) w be more than road cars, so the rear occupants will be pushed further forward than in a normal passenger car of a similar size.</p><p><em>Note:Many SUVs have high rear floors over the axles and this may create a low chair height for the rearmost passengers and also compromise the headroom.</em><em>Some largeSUVs with three rows ot passengers otten have very compromised rear seating that is only designed for children, small adults or pets</em></p><figure><img src="'+m+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="rear-occupants-vans" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rear-occupants-vans" aria-hidden="true">#</a> REAR OCCUPANTS - VANS</h3><p>Vans usually provide the most comfortable rear seating with easy ingress egress, but like the SUVs the third row may be compromised in smaller vehicles.</p><figure><img src="'+g+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>The rear suspension is often designed to create a low flat floor so the occupant package should be consistent from front to back.</p><p>Rear seating flexibility is becoming more common so providing the ability to slide, rotate and stow seats should be considered and may affect each seat&#39;s location.</p>',63),v=[f];function b(y,w){return e(),a("div",null,v)}const k=t(u,[["render",b],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{k as default};
