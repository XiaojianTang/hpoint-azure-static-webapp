Having said that, it&#39;s the. designer&#39;s responsibility to understand the next trends in technology, style and other market forces that may affect the. customer&#39;s opinions in the future. It is also important to &quot;read between the lines&quot;when the customer speaks, they don&#39;t always want what they say they want.There have been many examples of car manufacturers relying too much on custome input, only for their recommendations to be abandoned when something much better is produced</p><p>The first step in the product development cycle is the produci plan, which is usually prepared by the marketing group.

The main objective is to get started.Fortunately, the bulk of a vehicle&#39;s proportions are established by only a few elements, namely: the occupants,. powertrain, tires, cargo storage, ground clearance and crash protection systems. These can be put together in a logical order, but expect to iterate the design continually. Try to think about which components will drive the package and which will be. subordinate and why. As each system is added, it is going to affect the elements already located in the package, so do not be. afraid to start piecing the package together and making adjustments as the concept develops. Always be sure to reference the functional objectives that are driving the architecture. Usually, if you stick to sound logic, the package is quite simple to build and you will be able to defend the layout if it is ever challenged. The examples, on the following nine pages, show how differen types of vehicles can be approached with the same fundamental process even though they require totally different package solutions. Before creating the package geometry, loosely sketch out the package and arrange the major components based on. the functional objectives</p><p><strong>STEP 1 Package &amp; Design Ideation</strong></p><p>Loosely sketch out several package concepts based on the functional objectives. Include layouts of the occupants, cargo, powertrain, wheels and fuel. Also, think. about the body structure and closures (doors) and any other special features that may influence the package <img src="'+g+'" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p><strong>STEP 2 Set up the driver&#39;s height and posture</strong></p><p>Start by positioning the driver using the SAE 95th. percentile manikin.Establish the heel height from the. ground and then the seating posture. Consider the ground clearance and underbody structure when positioning the heel points. Before setting up the seating posture, think. about the following: downward visibility, center of gravity,. command-of-the-road seating, (eye point from ground) ngress/egress and aerodynamics. Probably the best way to get the driver location close is to look at existing vehicles with the same attributes and benchmark them.</p><figure><img src="'+m+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 3 Set up the rear</strong></p><p>Add the rear occupants if there are any. Again, use 95th percentile manikin with consideration for leg room and &quot;theater&quot; seating, if appropriate, to give. the rear occupants better forward visibility. Note tha. some specialty cars, such as coupes or very small sedans will not fully accommodate a 95th percentile manikin in the rear.With both manikins placed,. establish a spacial envelope around them and develop visibility goals. Look at the effective headroom and shoulder room first.then look at the up and down angles through the windshield apertures. Any other important relationships to the occupants should be noted at this stage</p><figure><img src="'+u+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 4 Select and install the powertrain</strong></p><p>Select and position the powertrain (engine, transmission and final drive). The choice of system may have a dramatic effect on the proportions. Choose it based on the amount and type of power required and also think about which wheels will be used to feed the power to the ground.. See Chapter 8 for more information on powertrain packaging.</p><figure><img src="'+f+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 5 Set up the occupants&#39; lateral location</strong></p><p>After the powertrain is positioned, set up the lateral position of the occupants. Consider the overall width limitation and the interior. environment expectations for the type of vehicle you are designing. The location of the manikins may also be affected by the. powertrain, aerodynamics, passenger pass-through and three. across seating.</p><p>Acommon mistake is not setting up the package in the end view at an early stage and then creating a vehicle that is too wide</p><figure><img src="'+b+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 6 Create space for the cargo</strong></p><p>The cargo space may be designed around specific objects or a volume target. Look to create a flexible interior environment with folding seats and bulkheads Weight will also be a consideration and this may affect the location and other elements in the architecture such as the body structure and suspension. Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on cargo packaqinq.</p><figure><img src="'+y+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 7 Size &amp; position the (primary) driven wheels</strong></p><p>Determine the size of the wheel and tire package and locate the spindles of the driven wheels relative to the occupants and powertrain. Study the packages on this page and note the relationship of these elements. They will differ greatly depending on the powertrain layout. See Chapter 9 for information on wheel &amp; tire choice and set up.Note that it is important to focus on the outside diameter of the tire and not the wheel size at this stage.</p><figure><img src="'+w+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 8 Establish the wheelbase</strong></p><p>The location of the other wheel/axle will depend on weight distribution or package efficiency.For smaller economy cars, the wheels will be as close to the. occupants as possible.For high-performance or luxury cars, the wheelbase will be set up to improve handling or comfort. Trucks and commercial vehicles need to place the wheels under the cargo area, to limit the effects on the steering when the vehicle is. loaded.</p><p>This is a good time to take another look at the ground clearance requirements. Once the tires are in position, the approach, departure and ramp over angles can be studied.</p><figure><img src="'+v+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 9 Set up the front &amp; rear tracks</strong></p><p>Although designers usually prefer the wheels to be as far outboard as possible, the track will be limited by the vehicle width target. The occupant package, cargo requirements or handling targets may also oush the wheels outboard</p><p>See Chapters 5, 7 &amp; 10 to understand some of the factors that qovern the track dimensions</p><figure><img src="'+k+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>STEP 10 Create the body and interior trim sections</strong></p><p>Develop the body and interior sections throughout the package.

This XYZ grid is created by the intersections of a series of horizontal, longitudinal and lateral planes. The grid reference system. is used as a reference between the CAD (computer-aided design) models (or drawings) and the clay models. The location of the vehicle components and section cutting planes are also referenced to the grid <img src="'+z+'" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><blockquote><p>The GRID ORIGIN POINT should be located out in front of the bumper and below the ground. Once created, it will always remain in the same place relative to the package. If the ground line is modified and pushed away from the body or the front fascia is moved forward, they will not move to a &quot;minus&quot; grid coordinate.</p></blockquote><p><strong>GROUND PLANES (LINES)</strong></p><p>During the design process, the body, powertrain, occupants etc. maintain their location in the grid system. The ground line, however is repositioned according to the location of the tire contact patch (This is opposite to the real world where the vehicle moves up and down on a fixed road). Three different factors will cause a variation in the relationship of the vehicle to the ground line: Loading, (attitude) tire size variation and ride height settings (illustrated)</p><p>Each require their own set of ground lines. There are several reasons to create a around line for each condition.</p><ol><li>Maintaining the required ground clearance.</li><li>Measuring the vehicle&#39;s overall height and step-in height is also a very important factor to consider.</li><li>Most vehicles are designed and modeled at &quot;CURB&quot; attitude.</li></ol><p><strong>Vehicle Attitudes</strong><img src="'+q+'" alt="image" loading="lazy"></p><p>As the vehicle is loaded, the ground line will move closer to the body.

SILL &amp; FLOOR HEIGHT</strong> Determined by the ground clearance, the ramp-over requirements of the vehicle and the underbody structure depth.The lowest point of the vehicle is often a chassis or powertrain component..</p><p><strong>2. FRONT WHEEL AND TIRE</strong> The front spindle height is. determined by the static load radius of the tire. Longitudinall. the jounce-and-turn tire envelope will establish the distance. of the front spindle from the driver&#39;s foot. It may also be moved further forward to influence the weight distribution of the vehicle.Also, the output shaft location from the. transmission will be a consideration for front-wheel drive (FwD) vehicles. The track is determined by a combination of the distance between the front structure frame rails and the tire turn envelope. Tire size will be limited by body size, suspension components and the vehicle&#39;s turning circle</p><p><strong>3. CHINHEIGHT</strong> The chin should clear a 162mm high parking block.A 10 approach-angle line (when the vehicle is fully loaded) is recommended for passenger cars.Above 28o is required for off road vehicles</p><p><strong>4. FRONT BUMPER LOCATION</strong> For passenger cars, the bumper system height must cover the &quot;bumper band&quot; which is generally. mandated to be from 406mm to 508mm above the ground.The longitudinal location must provide enough crush space in front of the occupant&#39;s feet to meet high speed (40mph) frontal impact requirements. Any object which will not compress on impact-i.e., the engine. transmission, steering rack, etc.-is added to this dimension. The offset of the bumper impact surface to the body and lamps will depeng. on the collision requirements and the manufacturing cost limitations of the system. To meet low-speed impact requirements, bumpers. with average cost and weight will require about 50-70mm of offset, but it is worth benchmarking vehicles with smaller offsets. The front fascia profile should be shaped to meet pedestrian protection safety requirements.</p><p><strong>5. LEADING EDGE</strong> Usually the cooling module affects the heigh and horizontal location of this point.Additional space is required for the hood latching structure and pedestrian protection.</p><p><strong>6.HOOD PROFILE</strong> Influenced by the position of the engine. induction system (manifolds, throttle body, etc).Recent European pedestrian head impact legislation has increased the required hood clearance to hard components. Toward the outboard edges suspension towers often affect the hood height.</p><p><strong>7. COWL / WINDSHIELD TOUCH DOWN</strong> The cowl height is limited by hardpoints generated from the engine clearance. envelope and driver visibility. A downward vision angle of less thar 5 may be a problem for shorter drivers.Longitudinal locations are controlled by engine maintenance access issues (forward) and proximity to controls (rearward). If the windshield is too far from the driver&#39;s eye point the A pillar may affect forward vision. An aggressive windshield installation angle may result in distorted. vision (65 from the vertical is about the maximum, guaranteed to avoid distortion with current glass technology)</p><p><strong>8.WINDSHIELD OPENING &amp; HEADER</strong> Determined by the head to headliner relationship, header structure thickness. The upward vision angle will help to set up the header location. An upward vision angle less than 11° is considerd a compromise.</p><p><strong>9.FRONT ROOF</strong> Should provide appropriate room over the manikin&#39;s head form for head clearance, trim and a sunroof if required.The roof should be as low as possible to reduce weight, lower the center of gravity and minimize frontal area to reduce aerodynamic drag.</p><figure><img src="'+D+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>10. REAR ROOF</strong> A similar condition to the front headroom is desirabl Many vehicles however will compromise rear headroom to allow for a ower or faster roof line.This is common in sports coupes and in the third row of an SUV where occasional seating is provided.</p><p><strong>11. REAR HEADER</strong> Similar to the front header. Hatchbacks will require additional structure in order to accommodate the mounting of the rear lift gate hinges.</p><p><strong>12. REAR CARGO</strong> Most vehicles will have some cargo storage; for. some it is a high priority.The height of the cargo area is governed by the size of the objects that are intended to be carried and the target storage. volumes. Rearward visibility will also limit the deck and bed heights.</p><p><strong>13. REAR BUMPER LOCATION</strong> Similar height requirements to the frq bumper but with additional consideration for load height variation whi is greater at the rear. Rear impact requirements influence the rearward Iocation of the bumper beam. The height of the fascia panel (bumper skin molding) will affect the lift over height for loading cargo.</p><p><strong>14. BODY REAR LOWER</strong> (Departure angle). Can be less than the approach angle (20 for off-road vehicles). Often the lowest parts of the car behind the rear wheels are the exhaust system and spare tire.. 15. REAR SPINDLE The track and height are set up in a similar way to the front. The longitudinal location is normally as close to the rear occupant as the tire envelope will allow. In the case of a cargo truck or minivan, weight distribution will be a factor.</p><figure><img src="'+N+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>16. ROOF RAIL SECTION</strong> The outer skin of the roof rail is established by a stack up of several internally positioned components, while providing adequate clearance to the. occupant head form. The section through the rail will comprise the body-in white (Biw) structure, the door frame, head impact protection, and trim. Additionally, side curtain airbags may be packaged. The type of door construction used will affect the siz. and shape of the roof rail section..</p><p><strong>17. SIDE GLASS</strong> Usually a radius, but occasionally flat. The. upper location is set up by the roof rail design and location.. The offset to the roof rail section depends on how it is constrained by the door system. The lower point at the belt line. is positioned to provide adequate shoulder room and ensure tha the glass will drop inside the door&#39;s outer profile</p><p><strong>18. BELT-LINE LOCATlON</strong> The height and width can be driven by the exterior design, but the relationship to the occupant. should be a consideration. The height relative to the occupants. can be checked against benchmark vehicles to ensure that it is not too extreme.Adequate shoulder room should be provided tc the door inner panel.</p><p><strong>19. BODY SIDE PROFILE</strong> Must be designed to allow the glass surface to drop inside the door section, miss of the hardware and obstructions within the door assembly. Side impact requirements will also play a part in s up the door outer surface.</p><p><strong>20. WHEEL COVERAGE</strong> Most vehicles will be designed to meet European wheel coverage requirements.This dard requires that the body work covers the outboard edge of the tires in a zone between a line 30° from vertical ard of the spindle and 50° rearward.</p><h2 id="section-2-6-basic-package-drawing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-2-6-basic-package-drawing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 2.6 Basic Package Drawing</h2><p>The initial package is usually developed accurately in a 3D CAD system, but as it progresses it needs to be clearly communicated to everyone involved in the project.
