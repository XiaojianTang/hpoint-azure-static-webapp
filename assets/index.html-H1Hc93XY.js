The occupants directly or indirectly influence every aspect of the vehicle's design.\\nIt is often said that cars and trucks should be designed from the inside out. This refers more to the occupant package than the interior systems. The main objective is to set up the driver and passengers to be comfortable and safe, then create an envelope around them and use key reference data within their geometries to set up the rest of the vehicle package. The most important reference point in the package is the driver's hip or H point.</p>"}`);export{e as data};
