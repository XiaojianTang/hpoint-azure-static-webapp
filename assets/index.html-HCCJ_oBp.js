It is based on notes created for the Vehicle Architecture class taught at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California"},{"details":"Packaging, or setting up the vehicle architecture, has always been a fundamental element in the creation of a successful product, which is why the main objective here is to empower designers to be part of the package development process from day one helping them to design from the ground up."},{"details":"History is full of vehicles with ground-breaking designs which were driven by an innovative package. Cars like the Chrysler Airflow, VW Beetle, Jeep Wrangler, BMC Mini and the McLarer. F1, for example, all pushed automotive design forward in their. own way and still influence car design today."},{"details":"The biggest challenge for the authors was to edit the. information down to a level that most students can digest. Fortunately, advanced concepts only require the designers to study the basic elements that influence the overall proportions and these are the main focus of this book."}]},{"header":"about the author - STUART MACEY","description":"Stuart Macey's career in the automotive industry has spanned three decades,. designing cars & trucks for over thirty brands in five countries. It began in 1979 with Pressed Steel Fisher, the body. division of British Leyland. He moved overseas in 1981 as the British car. industry slid into a rapid decline, working. in Germany on contract for Daimler-Benz and Audi, then moved to Detroit, working for Chevrolet.","image":"/assets/img/chapter_00/stuartmacey.jpg","highlights":[{"details":"Returning to Europe in 1983, Stuart workedtor International Automotive Design consulting with numerous clients such as. Porsche, Volvo, Honda,Renault, Kia, Opel, Mazda,Ford, Daf trucks & Freight Rover. The experience gained from working in studios. across Europe was priceless, helping him to understand that although every brand has its own perspective on design and the. process, the basic principles are the same everywhere."},{"details":"In 1991 he returned to the USA, to work with the Chrysler Design Office in Auburn Hills and their Pacifica Advanced Design Center in California until it closed in 2008."},{"details":"In 2002, Art Center College of Design invited Stuart to develop a new syllabus for their new vehicle architecture class.He currently teaches the class at Art Center part time, works as a studio engineer for a major auto manufacturer in Southern California and is president of Curb Industries LLC."}]},{"header":"about the author - GEOFF WARDLE","description":"Geoff Wardle initially studied ehicle engineering at Hatfield Polytechnic and followed that up. with a degree in Transportation.

There is no doubt that his combination of engineering and design has set him in good stead during his design career, allowing him to push really hard for technical solutions that enabled some of his design proposals to be successfully executed.
