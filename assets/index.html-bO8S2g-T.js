The first approach may be purely emotional. You may have already decided that the concept wil be large or small, high or low, have a short or a long hood. You will be working with a mindset that the vehicle needs to be. designed to look a certain way for the customer to accept it. If. this is the case, the package can often be designed under the skin, because there will be nothing revolutionary about it. It is taking what we already know today and simply refining it. This is a case of the package being lead by the design.</p>"}');export{e as data};
