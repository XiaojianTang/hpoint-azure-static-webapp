These are typically developed and manufactured by various suppliers who work with the major auto companies from the beginning of the design process.They will often be delivered to the assembly line complete and ready to install. The interior design on most projects will follow the exterior. There are exceptions, particularly if the vehicle interior has special features which will affect the overall package. such as rotating or stowing seat systems or special cargo needs.These will drive the initial package together with the occupants, creating hard points to work around.</p><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="design-for-safety" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-for-safety" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DESIGN FOR SAFETY</h3><p>An important concept to consider is that the interior must be safe.</p><p>Some parts contain the active and passive safety systems, such as the air bags, seat belts and knee blockers.They can be attached directly to the vehicle structure to aid their function.</p><p>Other items, such as the headrests and roof. linings are designed to prevent head and neck injuries, in the event of severe impacts.</p><p>The completed interior components will play a role in every safety test, so the location, shape, surface hardness and supporting structures have to be carefully designed to protect the occupants</p><figure><img src="'+n+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="instrument-panels-and-consoles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#instrument-panels-and-consoles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> INSTRUMENT PANELS AND CONSOLES</h3><p>Generally, the I.P. will not influence the exterior proportions of the car, so its design can follow the exterior. However, many of the key components are directly related to the driver location and posture to provide reach, visibility and safety. If the occupant package changes, it will tear up the I.P. and console design. This is one reason why the interior design is not developed to a great degree until the exterior development is quite advanced.</p><p>Overhead consoles will help redistribute some components and free up space on the l.P. but their size is often limited by the sunroof</p><figure><img src="'+r+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h3 id="door-pillar-trim-panels" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#door-pillar-trim-panels" aria-hidden="true">#</a> DOOR &amp; PILLAR TRIM PANELS</h3><p>Although these may appear to be of lesser importance to other interior components, many of the upper trim panels feature extensively in early package studies because they are designed to reduce head trauma if the occupants strike the upper body structure during an impact or rollover.

In most conventional interiors the area around the instrument cluster is very crowded, witl the steering column, instruments, I.P.structure and HVAC ducting all competing for the volume. The center stack layout also needs to be carefully prioritized and organized so that vent outlets, HVAC controls, displays, cup holders, switches and storage trays all fit and are ergonomically positioned.</p><p>Additional consideration must be given to safety because much of the instrument panel is within the head impact zone.This means that the contours, radii and hardness of all surfaces have to be designed to pass all interior safety legislation and testing procedures Also, during a high-speed frontal impact the occupants rely on the knee blockers and air bags to restrict their forward travel and cushion the impact.For this reason the relationship of the I.P. and controls to the driver and front passengers is critical, with everything set up for reach, vision and safety.Special consideration should be given to vehicles in global markets where both left and right-hand drive configurations are required..</p><figure><img src="'+u+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><em>The instrument panel is crammed with various system component many of these are safety related.

It&#39;s probably fair to say that many companies failed to meet these goals leaving their customers frustrated and hungry for better solutions.</p><p>More recently, the arrival of smart phones has created a whole new way of thinking about user interfaces and as the vast majority of drivers now want to connect their phones to the vehicle to access many important aspects of their life (music, contacts, phone, texting, email, internet and an ever growing number of apps that offer unlimited functionality) while they are driving.Designing for this is not only fraught with logistic issues but often creates a very dangerous environment for driving.</p><p>Visit www.distraction.gov. for more information on distracted driving</p><p>Fortunately, autonomous and semi autonomous driving. technology and legislation is on the horizon and the. responsibility of controlling vehicles is shifting away from the driver to be placed in the systems of the car and. surrounding infrastructure.</p><p>With this in mind, the scope of HMI will grow tremendously as vehicle owners choose to focus on other activities such as watching TV, working, sleeping, talking to other passengers etc., rather than actually driving. As technology continues to open up more opportunities a totally new approach to interior design will be required.</p><p>Traditionally, the design mindset was&quot;function and operation but with the opportunities that in-vehicle apps provide, designers should think in terms of &quot;content and delivery&quot;.This will help them create interfaces that are more aligned with peoples&#39; everyday experiences, such as using a smart phone rather than picking through a mass of buttons and knobs that are frustrating, confusing and inflexible.</p><p>Regardless of technology and customer needs, the basid principles for HMl design will always remain the same.

Traditional switches, buttons, turn knobs and levers may always be the best solution to many input operations, but alternative technologies such as touch, voice, gesture and eye tracking should always be considered where appropriate. Determining what technologies are applied and where is critica to the design of a perfect HMI system.</p><p>For receiving information the simple interfaces such as the. position of a turn knob or a colored light may quickly inform the. driver of the status of a system. However, the use of large. reconfigurable touch displays is shifting feedback to the driver or a more centralized location with a common visual image.

Other interfaces are scattered around the cabin in appropriate Iocations , i.e. door systems (locks, drop glass and mirrors) will usually be located on the doors. Sunroof and interior lighting will be incorporated into the overhead console.Any other systems that are required by the rear occupants shoulq have interface components located conveniently in the rear compartment.Where possible, the interface components should be clustered by system to make operation more convenient and intuitive.Many manufactures now offer remote features such as starting, unlocking and diagnostics from a smartphone app, so these interfaces need to be. included in each scenario.</p>',134),P=[j];function M(E,H){return t(),a("div",null,P)}const N=e(C,[["render",M],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{N as default};
