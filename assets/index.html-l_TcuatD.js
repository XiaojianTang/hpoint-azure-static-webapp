The normal tendency is for designers to want the largest wheel diameter with a very low profile tire. For most cars and trucks this is not good functionally</p><p>The outside diameter (O.D.) of the tire will always be limited, so looking at this dimension is the starting point. (see page 181 for examples) Next, the sidewall or profile height should be established based on the loading and performance targets. The wheel diameter will be derived from these two factors.The tire width will depend on traction requirements for acceleration, braking and cornering. Rolling resistance, cost and package space should also be considered. It is not uncommon for high performance cars to have different sized front and rear tires to orovide more traction at the driven wheels</p><p>Approximate wheel and tire sizes should be established quite early on in the design process, usually after the preliminary. occupant package has been set up.</p><p>Additionally, the suspension travel and steering angles should be predicted to determine the tire envelopes, which identify the total volumes occupied by the tires during extreme use..</p><p>Tires are manufactured in incremental sizes described with a formula for the tread width, sidewall aspect ratio and wheel size. The outside diameter is calculated from this.Light-truck tires. use a different formula, part of which includes the O.D.,. simplifying the process.</p><p>Tire specifications are somewhat complex because they are a mixture of millimeters, inches and a percentage. After estimating the tire dimensions, the diameter should be adjusted to a correct available size calculated from a typical tire specification as shown on page 200</p><p>Sidewall height is governed by load carrying requirements, ride comfort and handling.</p><p>Trucks and SUVs will have tall sidewalls to help increase thein gross vehicle weight (GVw) capability and protect the rims or rough terrain.Low-profile tires are preferred on sports cars to minimize sidewall flex during cornering. Narrow tires actually work better in snow, so a winter tire package may be smaller than the one for summer.</p><p>Styling also plays a big part in wheel and tire size so getting the wheel diameter to work with the proportions of the car may be the final determining factor on the exact wheel and tire package.</p><h3 id="tire-sidewall-heights-profiles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tire-sidewall-heights-profiles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TIRE SIDEWALL HEIGHTS &amp; PROFILES</h3><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Truck &amp; SUV Tire Profile</strong> Vehicles that are designed to carry heav. loads or travel over rough terrain require a taller sidewall to distribute the load an protect the rim from rock damage. The drawback of a taller aspect ratio is sidewall flex that will be detrimental to handling but will improve ride comfort.</p><p><strong>Passenger Car Tire Profile</strong> For cars that require a comfortable ride, an average sidewall height is advisable, providing a balance between comfort and handling. This configuration is usually less expensive than a larger wheel and low profile tire combination.</p><p><strong>Sports Car Tire Profile</strong> Performance cars will sacrifice comfort to improve cornering capability. The lo profile tire reduces side wall deflection and allows for a larger diameter wheel which provides room for a larger brake rotor, if required. It also improves the exterior appearance. A drawback is that the minimized sidewall height leaves the wheel rim vulnerable to damage from curbs and potholes.Also, the total weight of tire and rim will be higher, which increases the unsprung weight. This will counter against the handling benefits.</p><figure><img src="'+n+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Wheel Flange Diameters</strong> The flange diameter represents the actual visible wheel sizes.

The steering mechanisms are Iocated just behind or forward of the front spindle, (creating front or rear steer). The steering wheel is directly linked to the mechanism through the input shafts or steering column, which is divided into several segments and angled to reduce steering-column movement in a frontal impact. Rack and pinion is the most common system, and works with most vehicles. Recirculating ball systems are usually applied when a lot of suspension articulation is required.</p><p>The long track rods help to reduce &quot;bump steer&quot; (caused by the difference between the suspension and steering geometry) which results in the turn angle changing as the suspension travels in jounce or rebound. Below are three applications of the systems. Designers should note that the steering. mechanism attachment to the knuckle will affect the location of the brake caliper which is often used as a design element.</p><figure><img src="'+p+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><em>Note: the steering systems may not feature in the initial. package, as they rarely affect the exterior surface</em></p><h3 id="turn-circles" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#turn-circles" aria-hidden="true">#</a> TURN CIRCLES</h3><p>Steering objectives should be addressed at an early stage of the. packaging process. The turn-circle requirements will have a major. influence on the package.The diagrams below show the elements that control the turn circle. The front frame rails that run between the engine and the tires inhibit the steering angle. In the illustration below, if a larger (transverse) engine is required the track will have to be widened to maintain the same turn circle.</p><p>The two factors that control the turn circle are the wheelbase and the turn angle. Long-wheelbase vehicles will require a. greater turn angle. This is often made possible by the. Iongitudinal powertrain layout which allows the front frame rails to be moved inboard. Trucks with an extremely long wheelbase. may also require the rear wheels to steer to get the turn circle tc an acceptable diameter.</p><figure><img src="'+d+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p><em>Turn circles are usually about 10 met for small cars and 12 meters for large. cars.Large trucks and limosines with long wheelbases may have turn circl up to 15 meters.

This is a common location, allowing easy access in the event of a puncture.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that the rear overhang of some vehicles may be determined by the spare tire package.</p><p>Many customers want a full-size spare, and if the vehicle has a large tire O.D., packaging this may be challenging. Often space saver tires are used, but these can be no smaller than 80% of the original diameter to prevent wear on the differential.</p><p>Vehicles with higher floors (minivans and trucks) may package the spare further forward under the passenger compartment floor. SUVs often mount the spare on the rear swing gate.</p><figure><img src="'+m+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><h2 id="section-9-5-tire-coverage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-5-tire-coverage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9.5 Tire Coverage</h2><p>European legislation requires that the tires must be inboard of the body work in the zones shown below, 30 forward of the spindle center and 50 rearward</p><figure><img src="'+u+'" alt="image" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>image</figcaption></figure><p>The opening between the tire profile and the wheel arch will vary greatly depending on the function of the vehicle.
